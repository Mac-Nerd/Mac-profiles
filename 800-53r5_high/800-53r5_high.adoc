== Foreword

The macOS Security Compliance Project is an open source effort to provide a programmatic approach to generating security guidance. The configuration settings in this document were derived from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53, _Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations_, Revision 5.

This project can be used as a resource to easily create customized security baselines of technical security controls by leveraging a library of atomic actions which are mapped to the compliance requirements defined in NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5). It can also be used to develop customized guidance to meet the particular cybersecurity needs of any organization.  

The objective of this effort was to simplify and radically accelerate the process of producing up-to-date macOS security guidance that is also accessible to any organization and tailorable to meet each organizationâ€™s specific security needs.

Any and all risk based decisions to tailor the content produced by this project in order to meet the needs of a specific organization shall be approved by the responsible Information System Owner (ISO) and Authorizing Official (AO) and formally documented in their System Security Plan (SSP). While the project attempts to provide settings to meet compliance requirements, it is recommended that each rule be reviewed by your organization's Information System Security Officer (ISSO) prior to implementation.

== Scope

This guide describes the actions to take when securing a macOS 12 system against the NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 High-Impact Security Baseline.

== Authentication

This section contains the configuration of authentication settings, including the enforcement of smartcard authentication.  

NOTE: The check/fix commands outlined in this section must be run with elevated privileges.

=== Enforce Multifactor Authentication for Login

The system _MUST_ be configured to enforce multifactor authentication.

All users _MUST_ go through multifactor authentication to prevent unauthenticated access and potential compromise to the system.

IMPORTANT: Modification of Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) now require user authorization, or use of a Privacy Preferences Policy Control (PPPC) profile from MDM that authorizes modifying system administrator files or full disk access.

NOTE: /etc/pam.d/login will be automatically modified to its original state following any update or major upgrade to the operating system.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/grep -Ec '^(auth\s+sufficient\s+pam_smartcard.so|auth\s+required\s+pam_deny.so)' /etc/pam.d/login

----

If the result is not *2*, this is a finding.

====
**Remediation Description**

Perform the following to configure the system to meet the requirements:

[source,bash]
----
/bin/cat > /etc/pam.d/login << LOGIN_END
# login: auth account password session

=== Set Smartcard Certificate Trust to High

The macOS system _MUST_ be configured to block access to users who are no longer authorized (i.e., users with revoked certificates).  

To prevent the use of untrusted certificates, the certificates on a smartcard card _MUST_ meet the following criteria: its issuer has a system-trusted certificate, the certificate is not expired, its "valid-after" date is in the past, and it passes Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) checking.

By setting the smartcard certificate trust level to high, the system will execute a hard revocation, i.e., a network connection is required. A verified positive response from the OSCP/CRL server is required for authentication to succeed.

NOTE: Before applying this setting, please see the smartcard supplemental guidance.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/osascript -l JavaScript << EOS
$.NSUserDefaults.alloc.initWithSuiteName('com.apple.security.smartcard')\

=== Enforce Smartcard Authentication

Smartcard authentication _MUST_ be enforced.

The use of smartcard credentials facilitates standardization and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

When enforceSmartCard is set to "true", the smartcard must be used for login, authorization, and unlocking the screensaver.

CAUTION: enforceSmartCard will apply to the whole system. No users will be able to login with their password unless the profile is removed or a user is exempt from smartcard enforcement.

NOTE: enforceSmartcard requires allowSmartcard to be set to true in order to work.

NOTE: The BSM Audit subsystem has been marked as deprecated by Apple.

NOTE: The check/fix commands outlined in this section _MUST_ be run with elevated privileges. 

=== Configure Audit Log Files to Not Contain Access Control Lists

The audit log files _MUST_ not contain access control lists (ACLs).

This rule ensures that audit information and audit files are configured to be readable and writable only by system administrators, thereby preventing unauthorized access, modification, and deletion of files.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]

=== Enable Security Auditing

The information system _MUST_ be configured to generate audit records. 

Audit records establish what types of events have occurred, when they occurred, and which users were involved. These records aid an organization in their efforts to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.

The content required to be captured in an audit record varies based on the impact level of an organization's system. Content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes, for example, time stamps, source addresses, destination addresses, user identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access or flow control rules invoked.

The information system initiates session audits at system start-up.

NOTE: Security auditing is enabled by default on macOS.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):

=== Configure System to Shut Down Upon Audit Failure

The audit service _MUST_ be configured to shut down the computer if it is unable to audit system events. 

Once audit failure occurs, user and system activity are no longer recorded, and malicious activity could go undetected. Audit processing failures can occur due to software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.

=== Configure System to Audit All Authorization and Authentication Events

The auditing system _MUST_ be configured to flag authorization and authentication (aa) events.

Authentication events contain information about the identity of a user, server, or client. Authorization events contain information about permissions, rights, and rules. If audit records do not include aa events, it is difficult to identify incidents and to correlate incidents to subsequent events. 

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., via a module or policy filter).

=== Configure System to Audit All Administrative Action Events

The auditing system _MUST_ be configured to flag administrative action (ad) events.

Administrative action events include changes made to the system (e.g. modifying authentication policies). If audit records do not include ad events, it is difficult to identify incidents and to correlate incidents to subsequent events. 

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., via a module or policy filter). 

The information system audits the execution of privileged functions.

NOTE: We recommend changing the line "43127:AUE_MAC_SYSCALL:mac_syscall(2):ad" to "43127:AUE_MAC_SYSCALL:mac_syscall(2):zz" in the file /etc/security/audit_event. This will prevent sandbox violations from being audited by the ad flag. 


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):

=== Configure System to Audit All Failed Program Execution on the System

The audit system _MUST_ be configured to record enforcement actions of access restrictions, including failed program execute (-ex) attempts.

Enforcement actions are the methods or mechanisms used to prevent unauthorized access and/or changes to configuration settings. One common and effective enforcement action method is using program execution restrictions (e.g., denying users access to execute certain processes). 

This configuration ensures that audit lists include events in which program execution has failed. 
Without auditing the enforcement of program execution, it is difficult to identify attempted attacks, as there is no audit trail available for forensic investigation.

=== Configure System to Audit All Deletions of Object Attributes

The audit system _MUST_ be configured to record enforcement actions of attempts to delete file attributes (fd). 

***Enforcement actions are the methods or mechanisms used to prevent unauthorized changes to configuration settings. One common and effective enforcement action method is using access restrictions (i.e., denying modifications to a file by applying file permissions). 

This configuration ensures that audit lists include events in which enforcement actions prevent attempts to delete a file. 

Without auditing the enforcement of access restrictions, it is difficult to identify attempted attacks, as there is no audit trail available for forensic investigation.

=== Configure System to Audit All Failed Change of Object Attributes

The audit system _MUST_ be configured to record enforcement actions of failed attempts to modify file attributes (-fm). 

Enforcement actions are the methods or mechanisms used to prevent unauthorized changes to configuration settings. One common and effective enforcement action method is using access restrictions (i.e., denying modifications to a file by applying file permissions). 

This configuration ensures that audit lists include events in which enforcement actions prevent attempts to modify a file. 

Without auditing the enforcement of access restrictions, it is difficult to identify attempted attacks, as there is no audit trail available for forensic investigation.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/awk -F':' '/^flags/ { print $NF }' /etc/security/audit_control | /usr/bin/tr ',' '\n' | /usr/bin/grep -Ec '\-fm'

----

If the result is not *1*, this is a finding.

=== Configure System to Audit All Log In and Log Out Events

The audit system _MUST_ be configured to record all attempts to log in and out of the system (lo). 

Frequently, an attacker that successfully gains access to a system has only gained access to an account with limited privileges, such as a guest account or a service account. The attacker must attempt to change to another user account with normal or elevated privileges in order to proceed. Auditing both successful and unsuccessful attempts to switch to another user account (by way of monitoring login and logout events) mitigates this risk.

The information system monitors login and logout events.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/awk -F':' '/^flags/ { print $NF }' /etc/security/audit_control | /usr/bin/tr ',' '\n' | /usr/bin/grep -Ec '^lo'

=== Configure Apple System Log Files To Mode 640 or Less Permissive

The Apple System Logs (ASL) _MUST_ be configured to be writable by root and readable only by the root user and group wheel. To achieve this, ASL log files _MUST_ be configured to mode 640 permissive or less; thereby preventing normal users from reading, modifying or deleting audit logs. System logs frequently contain sensitive information that could be used by an attacker. Setting the correct permissions mitigates this risk.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/stat -f '%A:%N' $(/usr/bin/grep -e '^>' /etc/asl.conf /etc/asl/* | /usr/bin/awk '{ print $2 }') 2> /dev/null | /usr/bin/awk '!/640/{print $1}' | /usr/bin/wc -l | /usr/bin/tr -d ' '

=== Control Connections to Other Systems via a Deny-All and Allow-by-Exception Firewall Policy

A deny-all and allow-by-exception firewall policy _MUST_ be employed for managing connections to other systems. 

Organizations _MUST_ ensure the built-in packet filter firewall is configured correctly to employ the default deny rule.

Failure to restrict network connectivity to authorized systems permits inbound connections from malicious systems. It also permits outbound connections that may facilitate the exfiltration of data.

If you are using a third-party firewall solution, this setting does not apply. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Configuring the built-in packet filter firewall to employ the default deny rule has the potential to interfere with applications on the system in an unpredictable manner. Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) may make the risk-based decision not to configure the built-in packet filter firewall to employ the default deny rule to avoid losing functionality, but they are advised to first fully weigh the potential risks posed to their organization.

Single user mode, recovery mode, the Startup Manager, and several other tools are available on macOS by holding the "Option" key down during startup. Setting a firmware password restricts access to these tools.

To set a firmware passcode use the following command:

[source,bash]
----
/usr/sbin/firmwarepasswd -setpasswd
----

NOTE: If firmware password or passcode is forgotten, the only way to reset the forgotten password is through the use of a machine specific binary generated and provided by Apple. Schedule a support call, and provide proof of purchase before the firmware binary will be generated.

NOTE: Firmware passwords are not supported on Apple Silicon devices. This rule is only applicable to Intel devices.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/sbin/firmwarepasswd -check | /usr/bin/grep -c "Password Enabled: Yes"

----

If the result is not *1*, this is a finding.

====
**Remediation Description**

Perform the following to configure the system to meet the requirements:

NOTE: See discussion on remediation and how to enable firmware password.

=== Enable Gatekeeper

Gatekeeper _MUST_ be enabled. 

Gatekeeper is a security feature that ensures that applications are digitally signed by an Apple-issued certificate before they are permitted to run. Digital signatures allow the macOS host to verify that the application has not been modified by a malicious third party.

Administrator users will still have the option to override these settings on a case-by-case basis.

=== Configure System Log Files to Mode 640 or Less Permissive

The system logs _MUST_ be configured to be writable by root and readable only by the root user and group wheel. To achieve this, system log files _MUST_ be configured to mode 640 permissive or less; thereby preventing normal users from reading, modifying or deleting audit logs. System logs frequently contain sensitive information that could be used by an attacker. Setting the correct permissions mitigates this risk.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/stat -f '%A:%N' $(/usr/bin/grep -v '^#' /etc/newsyslog.conf | /usr/bin/awk '{ print $1 }') 2> /dev/null | /usr/bin/awk '!/640/{print $1}' | /usr/bin/wc -l | /usr/bin/tr -d ' '

----

If the result is not *0*, this is a finding.

====
**Remediation Description**

Perform the following to configure the system to meet the requirements:

[source,bash]
----
/bin/chmod 640 $(/usr/bin/stat -f '%A:%N' $(/usr/bin/grep -v '^#' /etc/newsyslog.conf | /usr/bin/awk '{ print $1 }') 2> /dev/null | /usr/bin/awk '!/640/{print $1}' | awk -F":" '!/640/{print $2}')

=== Ensure Secure Boot Level Set to Full

The Secure Boot security setting _MUST_ be set to full.

Full security is the default Secure Boot setting in macOS. During startup, when Secure Boot is set to full security, the Mac will verify the integrity of the operating system before allowing the operating system to boot. 

NOTE: This will only return a proper result on a T2 or Apple Silicon Macs.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/libexec/mdmclient QuerySecurityInfo | /usr/bin/grep -c "SecureBootLevel = full"

----

=== Ensure System Integrity Protection is Enabled

System Integrity Protection (SIP) _MUST_ be enabled. 

SIP is vital to protecting the integrity of the system as it prevents malicious users and software from making unauthorized and/or unintended modifications to protected files and folders; ensures the presence of an audit record generation capability for defined auditable events for all operating system components; protects audit tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion; restricts the root user account and limits the actions that the root user can perform on protected parts of the macOS; and prevents non-privileged users from granting other users direct access to the contents of their home directories and folders.

NOTE: SIP is enabled by default in macOS.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/csrutil status | /usr/bin/grep -c 'System Integrity Protection status: enabled.'

----

If the result is not *1*, this is a finding.

====
**Remediation Description**

Perform the following to configure the system to meet the requirements:

[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/csrutil enable
----
NOTE: To reenable "System Integrity Protection", boot the affected system into "Recovery" mode, launch "Terminal" from the "Utilities" menu, and run the command.

=== Disable Siri Setup during Setup Assistant

The prompt for Siri during Setup Assistant _MUST_ be disabled.

Organizations _MUST_ apply organization-wide configuration settings.

SSH _MUST_ be configured with an Active Server Alive Maximum Count set to zero. Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session or an incomplete login attempt will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.

=== Configure SSHD to Use Secure Key Exchange Algorithms

Unapproved mechanisms for authentication to the cryptographic module are not verified, and therefore cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, resulting in the compromise of DoD data.

Operating systems using encryption are required to use FIPS-compliant mechanisms for authenticating to cryptographic modules.

The implementation of OpenSSH that is included with macOS does not utilize a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module. While the listed Key Exchange Algorithms are FIPS 140-2 approved, the module implementing them has not been validated.

By specifying a Key Exchange Algorithm list with the order of hashes being in a "strongest to weakest" orientation, the system will automatically attempt to use the strongest Key Exchange Algorithm for securing SSH connections.

NOTE: /etc/ssh/sshd_config will be automatically modified to its original state following any update or major upgrade to the operating system.

=== Disable Root Login for SSH

If SSH is enabled to assure individual accountability and prevent unauthorized access, logging in as root via SSH _MUST_ be disabled. 

The macOS system MUST  require individuals to be authenticated with an individual authenticator prior to using a group authenticator, and administrator users _MUST_ never log in directly as root. 

NOTE: /etc/ssh/sshd_config will be automatically modified to its original state following any update or major upgrade to the operating system.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]

This prevents a malicious user from taking advantage of an unlocked computer or an abandoned logon session by bypassing the normal password prompt requirement.

This section contains the configuration and enforcement of settings pertaining to password policies in macOS.

NOTE: The check/fix commands outlined in this section _MUST_ be run by a user with elevated privileges. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
The password policy recommendations in the NIST 800-53 (Rev 5) and NIST 800-63B state that complexity rules should be organizationally defined. The values defined are based off of common complexity values. But your organization may define its own password complexity rules.
====

NOTE: The settings outlined in this section adhere to the recommendations provided in this document for systems that utilize passwords for local accounts. If systems are integrated with a directory service, local password policies should align with domain password policies to the fullest extent feasible.

=== Restrict Maximum Password Lifetime to 60 Days

The macOS _MUST_ be configured to enforce a maximum password lifetime limit of at least 60 days. 

This rule ensures that users are forced to change their passwords frequently enough to prevent malicious users from gaining and maintaining access to the system.

NOTE: The guidance for password based authentication in NIST 800-53 (Rev 5) and NIST 800-63B state that complexity rules should be organizationally defined. The values defined are based off of common complexity values. But your organization may define its own password complexity rules.

=== Automatically Remove or Disable Temporary or Emergency User Accounts within 72 Hours

The macOS is able to be configured to set an automated termination for 72 hours or less for all temporary or emergency accounts upon account creation. 

Emergency administrator accounts are privileged accounts established in response to crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is required. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability.

Although the ability to create and use emergency administrator accounts is necessary for performing system maintenance during emergencies, these accounts present vulnerabilities to the system if they are not disabled and removed when they are no longer needed. Configuring the macOS to automatically remove or disable emergency accounts within 72 hours of creation mitigates the risks posed if one were to be created and accidentally left active once the crisis is resolved. 

Emergency administrator accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon is not available). Infrequently used accounts also remain available and are not subject to automatic termination dates. However, an emergency administrator account is normally a different account created for use by vendors or system maintainers.

To address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.

If temporary or emergency user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for an excessive period, these accounts may be targeted by attackers to gain unauthorized access. To mitigate this risk, automated termination of all temporary or emergency accounts _MUST_ be set to 72 hours (or less) when the temporary or emergency account is created.

If no policy is enforced by a directory service, a password policy can be set with the "pwpolicy" utility. The variable names may vary depending on how the policy was set.

If there are no temporary or emergency accounts defined on the system, this is Not Applicable.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]

/usr/bin/pwpolicy -u username getaccountpolicies | tail -n +2

If there is no output, and password policy is not controlled by a directory service, this is a finding.

Otherwise, look for the line "<key>policyCategoryAuthentication</key>".

In the array that follows, there should be a <dict> section that contains a check <string> that allows users to log in if "policyAttributeCurrentTime" is less than the result of adding "policyAttributeCreationTime" to 72 hours (259299 seconds). The check might use a variable defined in its "policyParameters" section.

If the check does not exist or if the check adds too great an amount of time to "policyAttributeCreationTime", this is a finding.

----

If the result is not *N/A*, this is a finding.

====
**Remediation Description**

Perform the following to configure the system to meet the requirements:

This setting may be enforced using local policy or by a directory service.

To set local policy to disable a temporary or emergency user, create a plain text file containing the following:

<dict>
<key>policyCategoryAuthentication</key>
<array>
<dict>
<key>policyContent</key>
<string>policyAttributeCurrentTime < policyAttributeCreationTime+259299</string>
<key>policyIdentifier</key>
<string>Disable Tmp Accounts </string>
</dict>
</array>
</dict>

After saving the file and exiting to the command prompt, run the following command to load the new policy file, substituting the correct user name in place of "username" and the path to the file in place of "/path/to/file".

/usr/bin/pwpolicy -u username setaccountpolicies /path/to/file

=== Require Passwords Contain a Minimum of One Uppercase Character

The macOS _MUST_ be configured to require at least one uppercase character be used when a password is created.

This rule enforces password complexity by requiring users to set passwords that are less vulnerable to malicious users. 

NOTE: The guidance for password based authentication in NIST 800-53 (Rev 5) and NIST 800-63B state that complexity rules should be organizationally defined. The values defined are based off of common complexity values. But your organization may define its own password complexity rules.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/pwpolicy getaccountpolicies | /usr/bin/grep -v "Getting global account policies" | /usr/bin/xmllint --xpath '/plist/dict/array/dict/dict[key="minimumAlphaCharactersUpperCase"]/integer' - | /usr/bin/awk -F '[<>]' '{print $3}'

----

If the result is not *1*, this is a finding.

====
**Remediation Description**

Perform the following to configure the system to meet the requirements:

This setting may be enforced using local policy or by a directory service.

To set local policy to require at least 1 lowercase letter, edit the current password policy to contain the following <dict> within the "policyCategoryPasswordContent":

[source,xml]
----
<dict>
<key>policyContent</key>
<string>policyAttributePassword matches &apos;(.*[A-Z].*){1,}+&apos;</string>
<key>policyIdentifier</key>
<string>Must have at least 1 uppercase letter</string>
<key>policyParameters</key>
<dict>
<key>minimumAlphaCharactersUpperCase</key>
<integer>1</integer>
</dict>
</dict>
----
After saving the file and exiting to the command prompt, run the following command to load the new policy file, substituting the path to the file in place of "$pwpolicy_file".

[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/pwpolicy setaccountpolicies $pwpolicy_file
----
NOTE: See the password policy supplemental on more information on how to implement password policies on macOS.

=== Apply Gatekeeper Settings to Block Applications from Unidentified Developers

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate software prior to installation.

Gatekeeper settings must be configured correctly to only allow the system to run applications downloaded from the Mac App Store or applications signed with a valid Apple Developer ID code. Administrator users will still have the option to override these settings on a per-app basis. Gatekeeper is a security feature that ensures that applications must be digitally signed by an Apple-issued certificate in order to run. Digital signatures allow the macOS to verify that the application has not been modified by a malicious third party.

=== Configure Login Window to Prompt for Username and Password

The login window _MUST_ be configured to prompt all users for both a username and a password. 

By default, the system displays a list of known users on the login window, which can make it easier for a malicious user to gain access to someone else's account. Requiring users to type in both their username and password mitigates the risk of unauthorized users gaining access to the information system.

=== Disable Media Sharing

Media sharing _MUST_ be disabled.

When Media Sharing is enabled, the computer starts a network listening service that shares the contents of the user's music collection with other users in the same subnet. 

The information system _MUST_ be configured to provide only essential capabilities. Disabling Media Sharing helps prevent the unauthorized connection of devices and the unauthorized transfer of information. Disabling Media Sharing mitigates this risk.

NOTE: The Media Sharing preference panel will still allow "Home Sharing" and "Share media with guests" to be checked but the service will not be enabled.

=== Configure User Session Lock When a Smart Token is Removed

The screen lock _MUST_ be configured to initiate automatically when the smart token is removed from the system.

Session locks are temporary actions taken when users stop work and move away from the immediate vicinity of the information system but do not want to log out because of the temporary nature of their absences. While a session lock is not an acceptable substitute for logging out of an information system for longer periods of time, they prevent a malicious user from accessing the information system when a user has removed their smart token. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) may make the risk-based decision not to enforce a session lock when a smart token is removed, so as to maintain necessary workflow capabilities, but they are advised to first fully weigh the potential risks posed to their organization.

=== Disable Wi-Fi Interface

The macOS system must be configured with Wi-Fi support software disabled if not connected to an authorized trusted network. 

Allowing devices and users to connect to or from the system without first authenticating them allows untrusted access and can lead to a compromise or attack. Since wireless communications can be intercepted  it is necessary to use encryption to protect the confidentiality of information in transit.Wireless technologies include  for example  microwave  packet radio (UHF/VHF)  802.11x  and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols (e.g.  EAP/TLS  PEAP)  which provide credential protection and mutual authentication.

NOTE: If the system requires Wi-Fi to connect to an authorized network, this is not applicable.

== Inherent

This section reviews the controls that are built-in to macOS, and cannot be configured out of compliance.

=== Audit Record Reduction and Report Generation

The system _IS_ configured with the ability provide and implement an audit record reduction and report generation capability. 

Audit record reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit log information and organizes it into a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit record reduction and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same system or from the same organizational entities that conduct audit logging activities. The audit record reduction capability includes modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided by the system can generate customizable reports. Time ordering of audit records can be an issue if the granularity of the timestamp in the record is insufficient.

Audit record reduction and report generation can be done with tools built into macOS such as auditreduce and praudit. These tools are protected by System Integrity Protection (SIP).


The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement.

=== Configure the System to Protect Memory from Unauthorized Code Execution

The information system _IS_ configured to implement non-executable data to protect memory from code execution.

Some adversaries launch attacks with the intent of executing code in non-executable regions of memory or in memory locations that are prohibited (e.g., buffer overflow attacks). Security safeguards (e.g., data execution prevention and address space layout randomization) can be employed to protect non-executable regions of memory. Data execution prevention safeguards can either be hardware-enforced or software-enforced; hardware-enforced methods provide the greater strength of mechanism. 

macOS supports address space layout randomization (ASLR), position-independent executable (PIE), Stack Canaries, and NX stack and heap protection.

=== Limit Concurrent GUI Sessions to 10 for all Accounts

The information system _IS_ configured to limit the number of concurrent graphical user interface (GUI) sessions to a maximum of ten for all users. 

Operating system management includes the ability to control the number of users and user sessions that utilize an operating system. Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user helps reduce the risks related to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. This requirement addresses concurrent sessions for information system accounts and does not address concurrent sessions by single users via multiple system accounts. The maximum number of concurrent sessions should be defined based upon mission needs and the operational environment for each system.

=== Ensure the System Implements Malicious Code Protection Mechanisms

The inherent configuration of the macOS _IS_ in compliance as Apple has designed the system with three layers of protection against malware. Each layer of protection is comprised of one or more malicious code protection mechanisms, which are automatically implemented and which, collectively, meet the requirements of all applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for malicious code prevention.

1. This  first layer of defense targets the distribution of malware; the aim is to prevent malware from ever launching. 
The following mechanisms are inherent to the macOS design and constitute the first layer of protection against malicious code: 
*	The Apple App Store: the safest way to add new applications to a Mac is by downloading them from the App Store; all apps available for download from the App Store have been reviewed for signs of tampering and signed by Apple to indicate that the app meets security requirements and does not contain malware. 
*	XProtect: a built-in, signature-based, anti-virus, anti-malware technology inherent to all Macs. XProtect automatically detects and blocks the execution of known malware. 
  *	In macOS 10.15 and all subsequent releases, XProtect checks for known malicious content when:
    *	an app is first launched,
    *	an app has been changed (in the file system), and
    *	XProtect signatures are updated.
*	YARA: another built-in tool (inherent to all Macs), which conducts signature-based detection of malware. Apple updates YARA rules regularly.
*	Gatekeeper: a security feature inherent to all Macs; Gatekeeper scans apps to detect malware and/or revocations of a developer's signing certificate and prevents unsafe apps from running.
*	Notarization: Apple performs regular, automated scans to detect signs of malicious content and to verify developer ID-signed software; when no issues are found, Apple notarizes the software and delivers the results of scans to the system owner. 

2. The second layer of defense targets malware that manages to appear on a Mac before it runs; the aim is to quickly identify and block any malware present on a Mac in order to prevent the malware from running and further spreading. 
The following mechanisms are inherent to the macOS design and constitute the second layer of protection against malicious code: 
*	XProtect (defined above).
*	Gatekeeper (defined above).
*	Notarization (defined above).

3.  The third layer of defense targets infected Mac system(s); the aim is to remediate Macs on which malware has managed to successfully execute. 
The following mechanism is inherent to the macOS design and constitutes the third layer of protection against malicious code: 
*	Apple's Malware Removal Tool (MRT): a technology included on all macOS systems. MRT is an agent that remediates based on automatic updates delivered from Apple. MRT will remove the malware upon receiving updated information and check for malware on restart and login.

Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised.

The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement.

=== Automatically Remove or Disable Emergency Accounts within 72 Hours

The macOS is able to be configured to automatically remove or disable emergency accounts within 72 hours or less. 

Emergency administrator accounts are privileged accounts established in response to crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is required. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability.

Although the ability to create and use emergency administrator accounts is necessary for performing system maintenance during emergencies, these accounts present vulnerabilities to the system if they are not disabled and removed when they are no longer needed. Configuring the macOS to automatically remove or disable emergency accounts within 72 hours of creation mitigates the risks posed if one were to be created and accidentally left active once the crisis is resolved. 

Emergency administrator accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon is not available). Infrequently used accounts also remain available and are not subject to automatic termination dates. However, an emergency administrator account is normally a different account created for use by vendors or system maintainers.

To address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.


The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement.

=== Force Password Change at Next Logon

The macOS is able to be configured to force users to change their password at next logon.

Temporary passwords are often used for new users when accounts are created. However, once logged in to the system, users must be immediately prompted to change to a permanent password of their creation.

For a user to change their password at next logon, run the following command:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/pwpolicy -u [USER] -setpolicy "newPasswordRequired=1"
----
NOTE: Replace [USER] with the username that must change the password at next logon

=== Automatically Remove or Disable Temporary User Accounts within 72 Hours

The macOS is able to be configured to set an automated termination for 72 hours or less for all temporary accounts upon account creation. 

If temporary user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for an excessive period, these accounts may be targeted by attackers to gain unauthorized access. To mitigate this risk, automated termination of all temporary accounts _MUST_ be set to 72 hours (or less) when the temporary account is created.

If no policy is enforced by a directory service, a password policy can be set with the "pwpolicy" utility. The variable names may vary depending on how the policy was set.

If there are no temporary accounts defined on the system, this is Not Applicable.

== Permanent Findings

This section contains the controls that are defined in NIST 800-53 revision 5 but are unable to be configured natively within macOS. It is recommended to implement a third-party solution to meet the controls in this section.

=== Audit Record Reduction and Report Generation

The macOS should be configured to provide and implement the capability to process, sort, and search audit records for events of interest based on organizationally defined fields.

Events of interest can be identified by the content of audit records, including system resources involved, information objects accessed, identities of individuals, event types, event locations, event dates and times, Internet Protocol addresses involved, or event success or failure. Organizations may define event criteria to any degree of granularity required, such as locations selectable by a general networking location or by specific system component.

=== Must authenticate peripherals before establishing a connection

Organizational devices requiring unique device-to-device identification and authentication may be defined by type, by device, or by a combination of type/device. Information systems typically use either shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC] or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for device identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP], Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify/authenticate devices on local and/or wide area networks. Organizations determine the required strength of authentication mechanisms by the security categories of information systems. Because of the challenges of applying this control on large scale, organizations are encouraged to only apply the control to those limited number (and type) of devices that truly need to support this capability.


The technology does support this requirement, however, third party solutions are required to implement at an infrastructure level.

=== Protect Against Denial of Service Attacks by Ensuring Rate-Limiting Measures on Network Interfaces

The macOS should be configured to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by enforcing rate-limiting measures on network interfaces. 

DoS attacks leave authorized users unable to access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to the actions of a malicious cyber threat actor. When this occurs, the organization must operate at degraded capacity; often resulting in an inability to accomplish its mission. 

To prevent DoS attacks by ensuring rate-limiting measures on network interfaces, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level firewalls and networking equipment that meet or exceed this requirement.

== Not Applicable

This section contains the controls that are defined in the NIST 800-53 revision 5 but are not applicable when configuring a macOS system.

=== Access Control for Mobile Devices

A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.

Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.

Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to its network and impose a set of usage restrictions, while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile device connections to a system.

=== Information Input Validation

Check the validity of the following information inputs: organization-defined information inputs to the systems.

Checking the valid syntax and semantics of system inputsâ€”including character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable valuesâ€”verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. For example, if the organization specifies that numerical values between 1-100 are the only acceptable inputs for a field in a given application, inputs of "387," "abc," or "%K%" are invalid inputs and are not accepted as input to the system. Valid inputs are likely to vary from field to field within a software application. Applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the corrupted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing them to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation ensures accurate and correct inputs and prevents attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.

=== Non-Repudiation

Provide irrefutable evidence that an individual (or process acting on behalf of an individual) has performed organization-defined actions to be covered by non-repudiation.

Types of individual actions covered by non-repudiation include creating information, sending and receiving messages, and approving information. Non-repudiation protects against claims by authors of not having authored certain documents, senders of not having transmitted messages, receivers of not having received messages, and signatories of not having signed documents. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information originated from an individual or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a contract, approving a procurement request, or receiving specific information). Organizations obtain non-repudiation services by employing various techniques or mechanisms, including digital signatures and digital message receipts.

== Supplemental

This section provides additional information to support the guidance provided by the baselines.

=== Out of Scope Supplemental

There are several requirements defined in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations, Revision 5 that can be met by making configuration changes to the operating system. However, NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5) contains a broad set of guidelines that attempt to address all aspects of an information system or systems within an organization. Because the macOS Security Compliance Project is tailored specifically to macOS, some requirements defined in NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5) are not applicable. 

This supplemental contains those controls that are assigned to a baseline in NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5) which cannot be addressed with a technical configuration for macOS. These controls can be accomplished though administrative or procedural processes within an organization or via integration of the macOS system into enterprise information systems which are configured to protect the systems within.

=== FileVault Supplemental

The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:
  * sysprefs_filevault_enforce

In macOS 11 the internal Apple File System (APFS) data volume can be protected by FileVault. The system volume is always cryptographically protected (T2 and Apple Silicon) and is a read-only volume.

NOTE: FileVault uses an AES-XTS data encryption algorithm to protect full volumes of internal and external storage. Macs with a secure enclave (T2 and Apple Silicon) utilize the hardware security features of the architecture.

FileVault is described in detail here: link:https://support.apple.com/guide/security/volume-encryption-with-filevault-sec4c6dc1b6e/web[].

FileVault can be enabled in two ways within the macOS. It can be managed using the fdesetup command or by a Configuration Profile. When enabling FileVault via either of the aforementioned methods, you will be required to enter a username and password, which must be a local Open Directory account with a valid SecureToken password.

[discrete]
==== Using the fdesetup Command
When enabling FileVault via the command line in the Terminal application, you can run the following command.
[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/fdesetup enable
----
Running this command will prompt you for a username and password and then enable FileVault and return the personal recovery key. There are a number of management features available when managing FileVault via the command line that are not available when using a configuration profile. More information on these management features is available in the man page for `fdesetup`. 

NOTE: Apple has deprecated `fdesetup` command line tool from recognizing user name and password for security reasons and may remove the ability in future versions of macOS. 

[discrete]
==== Using a Configuration Profile

When managing FileVault with a configuration profile, you must deploy a profile with the payload type `com.apple.MCX.FileVault2`. When using the Enable key to enable FileVault with a configuration profile, you must include 1 of the following:

[source,xml]
----
<key>Enable</key>
<string>On</string>
<key>Defer</key>
<true />
----
[source,xml]
----
<key>Enable</key>
<string>On</string>
<key>UserEntersMissingInfo</key>
<true/>
----

If using the Defer key it will prompt for the user name and password at logout.

The `UserEntersMissingInfo` key will only work if installed through manual installation, and it will prompt for the username and password immediately. 

When using a configuration profile, you can escrow the Recovery key to a Mobile Device Management (MDM) server. Documentation for that can be found on Apple's Developer site: link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/fderecoverykeyescrow[].

It's recommended that you use a Personal Recovery key instead of an Institutional key as it will generate a specific key for each device. You can find more guidance on choosing a recover key here: link:https://docs.jamf.com/technical-papers/jamf-pro/administering-filevault-macos/10.7.1/Choosing_a_Recovery_Key.html[].

NOTE: FileVault currently only uses password-based authentication and cannot be done using a smartcard or any other type of multi-factor authentication. 


=== Packet Filter (pf) Supplemental

The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:

*	os_firewall_default_deny_require

macOS contains an application layer firewall (ALF) and a packet filter (PF) firewall.

  * The ALF can block incoming traffic on a per-application basis and prevent applications from gaining control of network ports, but it cannot be configured to block outgoing traffic.
  ** More information on the ALF can be found here: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201642 

  *  The PF firewall can manipulate virtually any packet data and is highly configurable. 
  ** More information on the BF firewall can be found here: https://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/index.html

Below is a script that configures ALF and the PF firewall to meet the requirements defined in NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5). The script will make sure the application layer firewall is enabled, set logging to "detailed", set built-in signed applications to automatically receive incoming connections, and set downloaded signed applications to automatically receive incoming connections. It will then create a custom rule set and copy `com.apple.pfctl.plis` from `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/` into the `/Library/LaunchDaemons` folder and name it `800-53.pfctl.plist`. This is done to not conflict with the system's pf ruleset.

The custom pf rules are created at `/etc/pf.anchors/800_53_pf_anchors`.

The ruleset will block connections on the following ports:

=== Password Policy Supplemental

The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:

  * pwpolicy_lower_case_character_enforce
  * pwpolicy_upper_case_character_enforce
  * pwpolicy_account_inactivity_enforce
  * pwpolicy_minimum_lifetime_enforce

Password policies should be enforced as much as possible via Configuration Profiles. However, the following policies are currently not enforceable via Configuration Profiles, and must therefore be enabled using the `pwpolicy` command:

  * Enforcing at least 1 lowercase character
  * Enforcing at least 1 uppercase character
  * Disabling an account after 35 days of inactivity
  * Password minimum lifetime

To set the local policy to meet these requirements, save the following XML password policy to a file.

[source,xml]
----
include::../../includes/pwpolicy.xml[]
----

Run the following command to load the new policy file, substituting the path to the file in place of "$pwpolicy_file".

[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/pwpolicy setaccountpolicies $pwpolicy_file
----

[NOTE]
====
If directory services is being utilized, password policies should come from the domain.

=== Smartcard Supplemental

The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:

  * auth_ssh_password_authentication_disable
  * auth_smartcard_enforce
  * auth_smartcard_certificate_trust_enforce_moderate
  * auth_smartcard_certificate_trust_enforce_high
  * auth_smartcard_allow
  * auth_pam_sudo_smartcard_enforce
  * auth_pam_su_smartcard_enforce
  * auth_pam_login_smartcard_enforce

macOS supports smartcards, such as U.S. Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards and U.S. Department of Defense Common Access Cards (CAC). Smartcards can be used on a macOS for the following:

  * Authentication (Loginwindow, Screensaver, SSH, PKINIT, Safari, Finder, and PAM Authorization (`sudo`, `login`, and `su`) )
  * Digital Encryption
  * Digital Signing
  * Remote Access (VPN:L2TP)
  * Port-based Network Access Control (802.1X)
  * Keychain Unlock

macOS has built-in support for USB CCID class-compliant smartcard readers.

[discrete]
==== Smartcard Pairing
The default method for using smartcards in macOS is a method called "local account pairing". Local account pairing is automatically initiated when a user inserts a smartcard into the Mac. The user is prompted to pair their smartcard with their account. If a user receives a new smartcard, the previous card must be unpaired, and the new card paired to the account. Local account pairing employs fixed key mapping with the hash of a public key on the user's smartcard with a local account.

[discrete]
==== Smartcard Attribute Mapping
Smartcards can be used to authenticate against a directory via attribute mapping configured in `/private/etc/SmartcardLogin.plist`. This file takes precedence over local account pairing. Attribute mapping matches the configured certificate field values from the smart card to the value in a directory. This may be used with network accounts, mobile accounts, or local accounts.

[discrete]
==== Smartcard Management in macOS

The following settings are available to manage smartcards (com.apple.security.smartcard):

[%header,cols="2,1,7"]
|===
|Key
|Type
|Value

<.^|userPairing
^.^|bool
|If false, users will not get the pairing dialog, although existing pairings will still work.

<.^|allowSmartCard
^.^|bool
|If false, the SmartCard is disabled for logins, authorizations, and screensaver unlocking. It is still allowed for other functions, such as signing emails and web access. A restart is required for a change of setting to take effect.

<.^|checkCertificateTrust
^.^|int
a|Valid values are 0-3:

- 0: certificate trust check is turned off

- 1: certificate trust check is turned on. Standard validity check is being performed but this does not include additional revocation checks.

- 2: certificate trust check is turned on, and a soft revocation check is performed. Until the certificate is explicitly rejected by CRL/OCSP, it is considered valid. This implies that unavailable/unreachable CRL/OCSP allows this check to succeed.

- 3: certificate trust check is turned on, plus a hard revocation check is performed. Unless CRL/OCSP explicitly states that "this certificate is OK", the certificate is considered invalid. This is the most secure value for this setting.

<.^|oneCardPerUser
^.^|bool
|If true, a user can pair with only one smartcard, although existing pairings will be allowed if already set up.

<.^|enforceSmartCard
^.^|bool
|If true, a user can only login or authenticate with a smartcard.

<.^|tokenRemovalAction
^.^|int
|If 1, the screen saver will automatically when the smartcard is removed.

<.^|allowUnmappedUsers
^.^|int
|If 1, allows users who are in a directory group to be exempt from smartcard-only enforcement. The group allowed for exemption is defined in /private/etc/SmartcardLogin.plist

|===

A custom configuration profile (`com.apple.loginwindow`) should be created to disable automatic login when FileVault is enabled. This ensures that authorized users boot their Macs, enter a password at the pre-boot screen (which decrypts the boot volume), and are then presented with a login window where they can authenticate with a smartcard.

[%header,cols="2,1,7"]
|===
|Key
|Type
|Value

<.^|DisableFDEAutoLogin
^.^|bool
|If true, both Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) login password and loginwindow PIN are required.

|===

NOTE: DisableFDEAutoLogin does not have to be set on Apple Silicon based macOS systems that are smartcard enforced as smartcards are available at pre-boot.

[discrete]
==== Trusted Authorities
The macOS allows users to specify which certificate authorities (CA) can be used for trust evaluation during smartcard authentication. Only CAs listed in the TrustedAuthorities section of the SmartcardLogin.plist will be evaluated as trusted. This setting only works if `checkCertificateTrust` is set to either 1, 2, or 3 in `com.apple.security.smartcard`.

To get the SHA-256 hash in the correct format, run the following command within terminal:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -inform pem -in <issuer cert> | /usr/bin/awk -F '=' '{print $2}' |  /usr/bin/sed 's/://g'
----

To configure Trusted Authorities, the `SmartcardLogin.plist` should be minimally configured as below:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>AttributeMapping</key>
    <dict>
          <key>fields</key>
          <array>
              <string>NT Principal Name</string>
          </array>
          <key>formatString</key>
          <string>Kerberos:$1</string>
          <key>dsAttributeString</key>
          <string>dsAttrTypeStandard:AltSecurityIdentities</string>
    </dict>
    <key>TrustedAuthorities</key>
  <array>
      <string>SHA256_HASH_OF_CERTDOMAIN_1,SHA256_HASH_OF_CERTDOMAIN_2</string>
  </array>
</dict>
</plist>
----

[discrete]
==== Smartcard Enforcement Exemption

[discrete]
===== Group Exemption

Starting in macOS 10.15, enforcement on a system can be granularly configured by adding a field to `/private/etc/SmartcardLogin.plist`. The `NotEnforcedGroup` can be added to the file to list a Directory group that will not be included in smartcard enforcement. In order to activate this feature, `enforceSmartCard` and `allowUnmappedUsers` must be applied via a configuration profile (`com.apple.security.smartcard`).

To configure the `NotEnforcedGroup`, the `SmartcardLogin.plist` should be minimally configured as follows:
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>AttributeMapping</key>
    <dict>
          <key>fields</key>
          <array>
              <string>NT Principal Name</string>
          </array>
          <key>formatString</key>
          <string>Kerberos:$1</string>
          <key>dsAttributeString</key>
          <string>dsAttrTypeStandard:AltSecurityIdentities</string>
    </dict>
    <key>TrustedAuthorities</key>
  <array>
      <string>SHA256_HASH_OF_CERTDOMAIN_1,SHA256_HASH_OF_CERTDOMAIN_2</string>
  </array>
    <key>NotEnforcedGroup</key>
    <string>EXEMPTGROUP</key>
</dict>
</plist>
----

Once a system is configured for the `NotEnforcedGroup` a user can be added to the assigned group by running the following:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/sbin/dseditgroup -o edit -a <exempt_user> -t user <notenforcegroup>
----

[discrete]
===== User Exemption

Alternatively, if a single user needs to be exempt for a period of time, `kDSNativeAttrTypePrefix:SmartCardEnforcement` can be set in the user's Open Directory record. The following values can be set:

* 0 - The system default is respected.
* 1 - Smartcard enforcement is enabled.
* 2 - Smartcard enforcement is disabled. 

NOTE: In Active Directory environments, the value of the `userAccountControl` attribute is respected.

Run the following command to set the exemption when booted from macOS:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/dscl . -append /Users/<username> SmartCardEnforcement 2
----

Run the following command to set the exemption when booted from Recovery:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/defaults write /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/<username> SmartCardEnforcement -array-add 2
----
NOTE: When booted to recovery on an Apple Silicon Mac, run the following after setting the exemption.
`/usr/sbin/diskutil apfs updatePreboot /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD`

[discrete]
===== Temporary Exemption

On an Apple Silicon Mac, if a temporary exemption is needed, `security filevault skip-sc-enforcement` will disable smartcard enforcement on next boot only. 

Run the following command to set the temporary exemption when booted from Recovery:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/security filevault skip-sc-enforcement <data volume UUID> set
----

To obtain the `data volume UUID` run the following:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/sbin/diskutil apfs listGroups | /usr/bin/awk -F: '/ Data/ { getline; gsub(/ /,""); print $2}'
----

[discrete]
==== Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM)

Terminal sessions in macOS can be configured for smartcard enforcement by modifying the PAM modules for `sudo`, `su`, and `login`.

[source,bash]
----
/etc/pam.d/sudo
# sudo: auth account password session
auth        sufficient    pam_smartcard.so
auth        required      pam_opendirectory.so
auth        required      pam_deny.so
account     required      pam_permit.so
password    required      pam_deny.so
session     required      pam_permit.so
----

[source,bash]
