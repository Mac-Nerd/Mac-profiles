== Foreword

The macOS Security Compliance Project is an open source effort to provide a programmatic approach to generating security guidance. The configuration settings in this document were derived from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53, _Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations_, Revision 5.

This project can be used as a resource to easily create customized security baselines of technical security controls by leveraging a library of atomic actions which are mapped to the compliance requirements defined in NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5). It can also be used to develop customized guidance to meet the particular cybersecurity needs of any organization.  

The objective of this effort was to simplify and radically accelerate the process of producing up-to-date macOS security guidance that is also accessible to any organization and tailorable to meet each organizationâ€™s specific security needs.

Any and all risk based decisions to tailor the content produced by this project in order to meet the needs of a specific organization shall be approved by the responsible Information System Owner (ISO) and Authorizing Official (AO) and formally documented in their System Security Plan (SSP). While the project attempts to provide settings to meet compliance requirements, it is recommended that each rule be reviewed by your organization's Information System Security Officer (ISSO) prior to implementation.

== Scope

This guide describes the actions to take when securing a macOS 12 system against the NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Low-Impact Security Baseline.

== Authentication

This section contains the configuration of authentication settings, including the enforcement of smartcard authentication.  

NOTE: The check/fix commands outlined in this section must be run with elevated privileges.

=== Enforce Multifactor Authentication for Login

The system _MUST_ be configured to enforce multifactor authentication.

All users _MUST_ go through multifactor authentication to prevent unauthenticated access and potential compromise to the system.

IMPORTANT: Modification of Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) now require user authorization, or use of a Privacy Preferences Policy Control (PPPC) profile from MDM that authorizes modifying system administrator files or full disk access.

NOTE: /etc/pam.d/login will be automatically modified to its original state following any update or major upgrade to the operating system.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/grep -Ec '^(auth\s+sufficient\s+pam_smartcard.so|auth\s+required\s+pam_deny.so)' /etc/pam.d/login

----

If the result is not *2*, this is a finding.

====
**Remediation Description**

Perform the following to configure the system to meet the requirements:

[source,bash]
----
/bin/cat > /etc/pam.d/login << LOGIN_END
# login: auth account password session

=== Enforce Smartcard Authentication

Smartcard authentication _MUST_ be enforced.

The use of smartcard credentials facilitates standardization and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

When enforceSmartCard is set to "true", the smartcard must be used for login, authorization, and unlocking the screensaver.

CAUTION: enforceSmartCard will apply to the whole system. No users will be able to login with their password unless the profile is removed or a user is exempt from smartcard enforcement.

NOTE: enforceSmartcard requires allowSmartcard to be set to true in order to work.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]

== Auditing

This section contains the configuration and enforcement of the OpenBSM settings.

NOTE: The BSM Audit subsystem has been marked as deprecated by Apple.

NOTE: The check/fix commands outlined in this section _MUST_ be run with elevated privileges. 

=== Configure Audit Log Files to Not Contain Access Control Lists

The audit log files _MUST_ not contain access control lists (ACLs).

This rule ensures that audit information and audit files are configured to be readable and writable only by system administrators, thereby preventing unauthorized access, modification, and deletion of files.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/bin/ls -le $(/usr/bin/grep '^dir' /etc/security/audit_control | /usr/bin/awk -F: '{print $2}') | /usr/bin/awk '{print $1}' | /usr/bin/grep -c ":"

----

If the result is not *0*, this is a finding.

====
**Remediation Description**

=== Configure Audit Log Folder to Not Contain Access Control Lists

The audit log folder _MUST_ not contain access control lists (ACLs).

Audit logs contain sensitive data about the system and users. This rule ensures that the audit service is configured to create log folders that are readable and writable only by system administrators in order to prevent normal users from reading audit logs.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]

=== Enable Security Auditing

The information system _MUST_ be configured to generate audit records. 

Audit records establish what types of events have occurred, when they occurred, and which users were involved. These records aid an organization in their efforts to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.

The content required to be captured in an audit record varies based on the impact level of an organization's system. Content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes, for example, time stamps, source addresses, destination addresses, user identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access or flow control rules invoked.

The information system initiates session audits at system start-up.

NOTE: Security auditing is enabled by default on macOS.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):

=== Configure System to Shut Down Upon Audit Failure

The audit service _MUST_ be configured to shut down the computer if it is unable to audit system events. 

Once audit failure occurs, user and system activity are no longer recorded, and malicious activity could go undetected. Audit processing failures can occur due to software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.

=== Configure System to Audit All Authorization and Authentication Events

The auditing system _MUST_ be configured to flag authorization and authentication (aa) events.

Authentication events contain information about the identity of a user, server, or client. Authorization events contain information about permissions, rights, and rules.

=== Configure System to Audit All Administrative Action Events

The auditing system _MUST_ be configured to flag administrative action (ad) events.

Administrative action events include changes made to the system (e.g. modifying authentication policies). If audit records do not include ad events, it is difficult to identify incidents and to correlate incidents to subsequent events. 

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., via a module or policy filter). 

The information system audits the execution of privileged functions.

NOTE: We recommend changing the line "43127:AUE_MAC_SYSCALL:mac_syscall(2):ad" to "43127:AUE_MAC_SYSCALL:mac_syscall(2):zz" in the file /etc/security/audit_event. This will prevent sandbox violations from being audited by the ad flag.

The audit system _MUST_ be configured to record enforcement actions of access restrictions, including failed program execute (-ex) attempts.

Enforcement actions are the methods or mechanisms used to prevent unauthorized access and/or changes to configuration settings. One common and effective enforcement action method is using program execution restrictions (e.g., denying users access to execute certain processes).

Without auditing the enforcement of access restrictions, it is difficult to identify attempted attacks, as there is no audit trail available for forensic investigation.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]

/usr/bin/awk -F':' '/^flags/ { print $NF }' /etc/security/audit_control | /usr/bin/tr ',' '\n' | /usr/bin/grep -Ec '\-fr'

=== Configure System to Audit All Failed Write Actions on the System

The audit system _MUST_ be configured to record enforcement actions of access restrictions, including failed file write (-fw) attempts.

Enforcement actions are the methods or mechanisms used to prevent unauthorized access and/or changes to configuration settings. One common and effective enforcement action method is using access restrictions (e.g., denying users access to edit a file by applying file permissions). 

This configuration ensures that audit lists include events in which enforcement actions prevent attempts to change a file. 

Without auditing the enforcement of access restrictions, it is difficult to identify attempted attacks, as there is no audit trail available for forensic investigation.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]

/usr/bin/awk -F':' '/^flags/ { print $NF }' /etc/security/audit_control | /usr/bin/tr ',' '\n' | /usr/bin/grep -Ec '\-fw'

=== Configure System to Audit All Log In and Log Out Events

The audit system _MUST_ be configured to record all attempts to log in and out of the system (lo). 

Frequently, an attacker that successfully gains access to a system has only gained access to an account with limited privileges, such as a guest account or a service account. The attacker must attempt to change to another user account with normal or elevated privileges in order to proceed. Auditing both successful and unsuccessful attempts to switch to another user account (by way of monitoring login and logout events) mitigates this risk.

The information system monitors login and logout events.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/awk -F':' '/^flags/ { print $NF }' /etc/security/audit_control | /usr/bin/tr ',' '\n' | /usr/bin/grep -Ec '^lo'

=== Disable Calendar.app

The macOS built-in Calendar.app _MUST_ be disabled as this application can establish a connection to non-approved services. This rule is in place to prevent inadvertent data transfers.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Some organizations allow the use of the built-in Calendar.app for organizational communication. Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) may make the risk-based decision not to disable the macOS built-in Mail.app to avoid losing this functionality, but they are advised to first fully weigh the potential risks posed to their organization.

=== Enforce Enrollment in Mobile Device Management

You _MUST_ enroll your Mac in a Mobile Device Management (MDM) software.

User Approved MDM (UAMDM) enrollment or enrollment via Apple Business Manager (ABM)/Apple School Manager (ASM) is required to manage certain security settings. Currently these include:

* Allowed Kernel Extensions
* Allowed Approved System Extensions
* Privacy Preferences Policy Control Payload
* ExtensibleSingleSignOn
* FDEFileVault

In macOS 11, UAMDM grants Supervised status on a Mac, unlocking the following MDM features, which were previously locked behind ABM:

* Activation Lock Bypass
* Access to Bootstrap Tokens
* Scheduling Software Updates
* Query list and delete local users


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/profiles status -type enrollment | /usr/bin/awk -F: '/MDM enrollment/ {print $2}' | /usr/bin/grep -c "Yes (User Approved)"

----

If the result is not *1*, this is a finding.

====
**Remediation Description**

Perform the following to configure the system to meet the requirements:

Ensure that system is enrolled via UAMDM.

=== Ensure System Integrity Protection is Enabled

System Integrity Protection (SIP) _MUST_ be enabled. 

SIP is vital to protecting the integrity of the system as it prevents malicious users and software from making unauthorized and/or unintended modifications to protected files and folders; ensures the presence of an audit record generation capability for defined auditable events for all operating system components; protects audit tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion; restricts the root user account and limits the actions that the root user can perform on protected parts of the macOS; and prevents non-privileged users from granting other users direct access to the contents of their home directories and folders.

NOTE: SIP is enabled by default in macOS.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/csrutil status | /usr/bin/grep -c 'System Integrity Protection status: enabled.'

----

If the result is not *1*, this is a finding.

====
**Remediation Description**

Perform the following to configure the system to meet the requirements:

[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/csrutil enable
----
NOTE: To reenable "System Integrity Protection", boot the affected system into "Recovery" mode, launch "Terminal" from the "Utilities" menu, and run the command.

=== Configure SSHD to Use Secure Key Exchange Algorithms

Unapproved mechanisms for authentication to the cryptographic module are not verified, and therefore cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, resulting in the compromise of DoD data.

Operating systems using encryption are required to use FIPS-compliant mechanisms for authenticating to cryptographic modules.

The implementation of OpenSSH that is included with macOS does not utilize a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module. While the listed Key Exchange Algorithms are FIPS 140-2 approved, the module implementing them has not been validated.

By specifying a Key Exchange Algorithm list with the order of hashes being in a "strongest to weakest" orientation, the system will automatically attempt to use the strongest Key Exchange Algorithm for securing SSH connections.

NOTE: /etc/ssh/sshd_config will be automatically modified to its original state following any update or major upgrade to the operating system.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]

=== Disable TouchID Prompt during Setup Assistant

The prompt for TouchID during Setup Assistant _MUST_ be disabled.

macOS prompts new users through enabling TouchID during Setup Assistant; this is not essential and, therefore, _MUST_ be disabled to prevent against the risk of individuals electing to enable TouchID to override organization-wide settings.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/osascript -l JavaScript << EOS
$.NSUserDefaults.alloc.initWithSuiteName('com.apple.SetupAssistant.managed')\

=== Disable Login to Other User's Active and Locked Sessions

The ability to log in to another user's active or locked session _MUST_ be disabled. 

macOS has a privilege that can be granted to any user that will allow that user to unlock active user's sessions. Disabling the admins and/or user's ability to log into another user's active andlocked session prevents unauthorized persons from viewing potentially sensitive and/or personal information.

The system _MUST_ not have the Unix-to-Unix Copy Protocol (UUCP) service active.

UUCP, a set of programs that enable the sending of files between different UNIX systems as well as sending commands to be executed on another system, is not essential and _MUST_ be disabled in order to prevent the unauthorized connection of devices, transfer of information, and tunneling. 

NOTE: UUCP service is disabled at startup by default macOS.

== Password Policy

This section contains the configuration and enforcement of settings pertaining to password policies in macOS.

NOTE: The check/fix commands outlined in this section _MUST_ be run by a user with elevated privileges. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
The password policy recommendations in the NIST 800-53 (Rev 5) and NIST 800-63B state that complexity rules should be organizationally defined. The values defined are based off of common complexity values. But your organization may define its own password complexity rules.
====

NOTE: The settings outlined in this section adhere to the recommendations provided in this document for systems that utilize passwords for local accounts. If systems are integrated with a directory service, local password policies should align with domain password policies to the fullest extent feasible.

=== Restrict Maximum Password Lifetime to 60 Days

The macOS _MUST_ be configured to enforce a maximum password lifetime limit of at least 60 days. 

This rule ensures that users are forced to change their passwords frequently enough to prevent malicious users from gaining and maintaining access to the system.

NOTE: The guidance for password based authentication in NIST 800-53 (Rev 5) and NIST 800-63B state that complexity rules should be organizationally defined. The values defined are based off of common complexity values. But your organization may define its own password complexity rules.

<dict>
<key>policyContent</key>
<string>policyAttributeLastPasswordChangeTime &lt; policyAttributeCurrentTime - (policyAttributeMinimumLifetimeHours * 60 * 60)</string>

After saving the file and exiting to the command prompt, run the following command to load the new policy file, substituting the path to the file in place of "$pwpolicy_file".

[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/pwpolicy setaccountpolicies $pwpolicy_file

=== Prohibit Repeating, Ascending, and Descending Character Sequences

The macOS _MUST_ be configured to prohibit the use of repeating, ascending, and descending character sequences when a password is created.

This rule enforces password complexity by requiring users to set passwords that are less vulnerable to malicious users.

NOTE: The guidance for password based authentication in NIST 800-53 (Rev 5) and NIST 800-63B state that complexity rules should be organizationally defined. The values defined are based off of common complexity values. But your organization may define its own password complexity rules.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/osascript -l JavaScript << EOS
$.NSUserDefaults.alloc.initWithSuiteName('com.apple.mobiledevice.passwordpolicy')\
.objectForKey('allowSimple').js

If the result is not *false*, this is a finding.

=== Disable Find My Service

The Find My service _MUST_ be disabled.

A Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution _MUST_ be used to carry out remote locking and wiping instead of Apple's Find My service.

Apple's Find My service uses a personal AppleID for authentication. Organizations should rely on MDM solutions, which have much more secure authentication requirements, to perform remote lock and remote wipe.

=== Apply Gatekeeper Settings to Block Applications from Unidentified Developers

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate software prior to installation.

Gatekeeper settings must be configured correctly to only allow the system to run applications downloaded from the Mac App Store or applications signed with a valid Apple Developer ID code. Administrator users will still have the option to override these settings on a per-app basis. Gatekeeper is a security feature that ensures that applications must be digitally signed by an Apple-issued certificate in order to run. Digital signatures allow the macOS to verify that the application has not been modified by a malicious third party.

=== Configure Login Window to Prompt for Username and Password

The login window _MUST_ be configured to prompt all users for both a username and a password. 

By default, the system displays a list of known users on the login window, which can make it easier for a malicious user to gain access to someone else's account. Requiring users to type in both their username and password mitigates the risk of unauthorized users gaining access to the information system. 


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/osascript -l JavaScript << EOS
$.NSUserDefaults.alloc.initWithSuiteName('com.apple.loginwindow')\
.objectForKey('SHOWFULLNAME').js
EOS

----

If the result is not *true*, this is a finding.

====
**Remediation Description**

Perform the following to configure the system to meet the requirements:

Create a configuration profile containing the following keys in the (com.apple.loginwindow) payload type:

=== Disable Media Sharing

Media sharing _MUST_ be disabled.

When Media Sharing is enabled, the computer starts a network listening service that shares the contents of the user's music collection with other users in the same subnet. 

The information system _MUST_ be configured to provide only essential capabilities. Disabling Media Sharing helps prevent the unauthorized connection of devices and the unauthorized transfer of information. Disabling Media Sharing mitigates this risk.

NOTE: The Media Sharing preference panel will still allow "Home Sharing" and "Share media with guests" to be checked but the service will not be enabled.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]

=== Disable Wi-Fi Interface

The macOS system must be configured with Wi-Fi support software disabled if not connected to an authorized trusted network. 

Allowing devices and users to connect to or from the system without first authenticating them allows untrusted access and can lead to a compromise or attack. Since wireless communications can be intercepted  it is necessary to use encryption to protect the confidentiality of information in transit.Wireless technologies include  for example  microwave  packet radio (UHF/VHF)  802.11x  and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols (e.g.  EAP/TLS  PEAP)  which provide credential protection and mutual authentication.

NOTE: If the system requires Wi-Fi to connect to an authorized network, this is not applicable.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]

=== Enforce Approved Authorization for Logical Access

The information system _IS_ configured to enforce an approved authorization process before granting users logical access. 

The inherent configuration of the macOS does not grant users logical access without authorization. Authorization is achieved on the macOS through permissions, which are controlled at many levels, from the Mach and BSD components of the kernel, through higher levels of the operating system and, for networked applications, through the networking protocols. Permissions can be granted at the level of directories, subdirectories, files or applications, or specific data within files or functions within applications.

=== Ensure the System Implements Malicious Code Protection Mechanisms

The inherent configuration of the macOS _IS_ in compliance as Apple has designed the system with three layers of protection against malware. Each layer of protection is comprised of one or more malicious code protection mechanisms, which are automatically implemented and which, collectively, meet the requirements of all applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for malicious code prevention.

1. This  first layer of defense targets the distribution of malware; the aim is to prevent malware from ever launching. 
The following mechanisms are inherent to the macOS design and constitute the first layer of protection against malicious code: 
*	The Apple App Store: the safest way to add new applications to a Mac is by downloading them from the App Store; all apps available for download from the App Store have been reviewed for signs of tampering and signed by Apple to indicate that the app meets security requirements and does not contain malware. 
*	XProtect: a built-in, signature-based, anti-virus, anti-malware technology inherent to all Macs. XProtect automatically detects and blocks the execution of known malware. 
  *	In macOS 10.15 and all subsequent releases, XProtect checks for known malicious content when:
    *	an app is first launched,
    *	an app has been changed (in the file system), and
    *	XProtect signatures are updated.
*	YARA: another built-in tool (inherent to all Macs), which conducts signature-based detection of malware. Apple updates YARA rules regularly.
*	Gatekeeper: a security feature inherent to all Macs; Gatekeeper scans apps to detect malware and/or revocations of a developer's signing certificate and prevents unsafe apps from running.
*	Notarization: Apple performs regular, automated scans to detect signs of malicious content and to verify developer ID-signed software; when no issues are found, Apple notarizes the software and delivers the results of scans to the system owner. 

2. The second layer of defense targets malware that manages to appear on a Mac before it runs; the aim is to quickly identify and block any malware present on a Mac in order to prevent the malware from running and further spreading. 
The following mechanisms are inherent to the macOS design and constitute the second layer of protection against malicious code: 
*	XProtect (defined above).
*	Gatekeeper (defined above).
*	Notarization (defined above).

3.  The third layer of defense targets infected Mac system(s); the aim is to remediate Macs on which malware has managed to successfully execute. 
The following mechanism is inherent to the macOS design and constitutes the third layer of protection against malicious code: 
*	Apple's Malware Removal Tool (MRT): a technology included on all macOS systems. MRT is an agent that remediates based on automatic updates delivered from Apple. MRT will remove the malware upon receiving updated information and check for malware on restart and login.

=== Force Password Change at Next Logon

The macOS is able to be configured to force users to change their password at next logon.

Temporary passwords are often used for new users when accounts are created. However, once logged in to the system, users must be immediately prompted to change to a permanent password of their creation.

For a user to change their password at next logon, run the following command:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/pwpolicy -u [USER] -setpolicy "newPasswordRequired=1"
----
NOTE: Replace [USER] with the username that must change the password at next logon


The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement.

== Permanent Findings

This section contains the controls that are defined in NIST 800-53 revision 5 but are unable to be configured natively within macOS. It is recommended to implement a third-party solution to meet the controls in this section.

=== Protect Against Denial of Service Attacks by Ensuring Rate-Limiting Measures on Network Interfaces

The macOS should be configured to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by enforcing rate-limiting measures on network interfaces. 

DoS attacks leave authorized users unable to access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to the actions of a malicious cyber threat actor. When this occurs, the organization must operate at degraded capacity; often resulting in an inability to accomplish its mission. 

To prevent DoS attacks by ensuring rate-limiting measures on network interfaces, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level firewalls and networking equipment that meet or exceed this requirement.


The technology does not support this requirement. This is an applicable-does not meet finding.

=== Require Devices to Reauthenticate when Changing Authenticators

The macOS should be configured to require users to reauthenticate when the device authenticator is changed. 

Without reauthentication, users may access resources or perform tasks for which they are not authorization. When operating systems provide the capability to change device authenticators, it is critical the device reauthenticate.

== Not Applicable

This section contains the controls that are defined in the NIST 800-53 revision 5 but are not applicable when configuring a macOS system.

=== Access Control for Mobile Devices

A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.

Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.

Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to its network and impose a set of usage restrictions, while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile device connections to a system.


The technology does not support this requirement. This is an applicable-does not meet finding.

== Supplemental

This section provides additional information to support the guidance provided by the baselines.

=== Out of Scope Supplemental

There are several requirements defined in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations, Revision 5 that can be met by making configuration changes to the operating system. However, NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5) contains a broad set of guidelines that attempt to address all aspects of an information system or systems within an organization. Because the macOS Security Compliance Project is tailored specifically to macOS, some requirements defined in NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5) are not applicable. 

This supplemental contains those controls that are assigned to a baseline in NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5) which cannot be addressed with a technical configuration for macOS. These controls can be accomplished though administrative or procedural processes within an organization or via integration of the macOS system into enterprise information systems which are configured to protect the systems within.

=== FileVault Supplemental

The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:
  * sysprefs_filevault_enforce

In macOS 11 the internal Apple File System (APFS) data volume can be protected by FileVault. The system volume is always cryptographically protected (T2 and Apple Silicon) and is a read-only volume.

NOTE: FileVault uses an AES-XTS data encryption algorithm to protect full volumes of internal and external storage. Macs with a secure enclave (T2 and Apple Silicon) utilize the hardware security features of the architecture.

FileVault is described in detail here: link:https://support.apple.com/guide/security/volume-encryption-with-filevault-sec4c6dc1b6e/web[].

FileVault can be enabled in two ways within the macOS. It can be managed using the fdesetup command or by a Configuration Profile. When enabling FileVault via either of the aforementioned methods, you will be required to enter a username and password, which must be a local Open Directory account with a valid SecureToken password.

[discrete]
==== Using the fdesetup Command
When enabling FileVault via the command line in the Terminal application, you can run the following command.
[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/fdesetup enable
----
Running this command will prompt you for a username and password and then enable FileVault and return the personal recovery key. There are a number of management features available when managing FileVault via the command line that are not available when using a configuration profile. More information on these management features is available in the man page for `fdesetup`. 

NOTE: Apple has deprecated `fdesetup` command line tool from recognizing user name and password for security reasons and may remove the ability in future versions of macOS. 

[discrete]
==== Using a Configuration Profile

When managing FileVault with a configuration profile, you must deploy a profile with the payload type `com.apple.MCX.FileVault2`. When using the Enable key to enable FileVault with a configuration profile, you must include 1 of the following:

[source,xml]
----
<key>Enable</key>
<string>On</string>
<key>Defer</key>
<true />
----
[source,xml]
----
<key>Enable</key>
<string>On</string>
<key>UserEntersMissingInfo</key>
<true/>
----

If using the Defer key it will prompt for the user name and password at logout.

The `UserEntersMissingInfo` key will only work if installed through manual installation, and it will prompt for the username and password immediately. 

When using a configuration profile, you can escrow the Recovery key to a Mobile Device Management (MDM) server. Documentation for that can be found on Apple's Developer site: link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/fderecoverykeyescrow[].

It's recommended that you use a Personal Recovery key instead of an Institutional key as it will generate a specific key for each device. You can find more guidance on choosing a recover key here: link:https://docs.jamf.com/technical-papers/jamf-pro/administering-filevault-macos/10.7.1/Choosing_a_Recovery_Key.html[].

NOTE: FileVault currently only uses password-based authentication and cannot be done using a smartcard or any other type of multi-factor authentication. 


=== Packet Filter (pf) Supplemental

The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:

*	os_firewall_default_deny_require

macOS contains an application layer firewall (ALF) and a packet filter (PF) firewall.

  * The ALF can block incoming traffic on a per-application basis and prevent applications from gaining control of network ports, but it cannot be configured to block outgoing traffic.
  ** More information on the ALF can be found here: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201642 

  *  The PF firewall can manipulate virtually any packet data and is highly configurable. 
  ** More information on the BF firewall can be found here: https://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/index.html

Below is a script that configures ALF and the PF firewall to meet the requirements defined in NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5). The script will make sure the application layer firewall is enabled, set logging to "detailed", set built-in signed applications to automatically receive incoming connections, and set downloaded signed applications to automatically receive incoming connections. It will then create a custom rule set and copy `com.apple.pfctl.plis` from `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/` into the `/Library/LaunchDaemons` folder and name it `800-53.pfctl.plist`. This is done to not conflict with the system's pf ruleset.

The custom pf rules are created at `/etc/pf.anchors/800_53_pf_anchors`.

The ruleset will block connections on the following ports:

----


=== Password Policy Supplemental

The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:

  * pwpolicy_lower_case_character_enforce
  * pwpolicy_upper_case_character_enforce
  * pwpolicy_account_inactivity_enforce
  * pwpolicy_minimum_lifetime_enforce

Password policies should be enforced as much as possible via Configuration Profiles. However, the following policies are currently not enforceable via Configuration Profiles, and must therefore be enabled using the `pwpolicy` command:

  * Enforcing at least 1 lowercase character
  * Enforcing at least 1 uppercase character
  * Disabling an account after 35 days of inactivity
  * Password minimum lifetime

To set the local policy to meet these requirements, save the following XML password policy to a file.

[source,xml]
----
include::../../includes/pwpolicy.xml[]
----

Run the following command to load the new policy file, substituting the path to the file in place of "$pwpolicy_file".

[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/pwpolicy setaccountpolicies $pwpolicy_file
----

[NOTE]
====
If directory services is being utilized, password policies should come from the domain.
====


=== Smartcard Supplemental

The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:

  * auth_ssh_password_authentication_disable
  * auth_smartcard_enforce
  * auth_smartcard_certificate_trust_enforce_moderate
  * auth_smartcard_certificate_trust_enforce_high
  * auth_smartcard_allow
  * auth_pam_sudo_smartcard_enforce
  * auth_pam_su_smartcard_enforce
  * auth_pam_login_smartcard_enforce

macOS supports smartcards, such as U.S. Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards and U.S. Department of Defense Common Access Cards (CAC). Smartcards can be used on a macOS for the following:

  * Authentication (Loginwindow, Screensaver, SSH, PKINIT, Safari, Finder, and PAM Authorization (`sudo`, `login`, and `su`) )
  * Digital Encryption
  * Digital Signing
  * Remote Access (VPN:L2TP)
  * Port-based Network Access Control (802.1X)
  * Keychain Unlock

macOS has built-in support for USB CCID class-compliant smartcard readers.

[discrete]
==== Smartcard Pairing
The default method for using smartcards in macOS is a method called "local account pairing". Local account pairing is automatically initiated when a user inserts a smartcard into the Mac. The user is prompted to pair their smartcard with their account. If a user receives a new smartcard, the previous card must be unpaired, and the new card paired to the account. Local account pairing employs fixed key mapping with the hash of a public key on the user's smartcard with a local account.

[discrete]
==== Smartcard Attribute Mapping
Smartcards can be used to authenticate against a directory via attribute mapping configured in `/private/etc/SmartcardLogin.plist`. This file takes precedence over local account pairing. Attribute mapping matches the configured certificate field values from the smart card to the value in a directory. This may be used with network accounts, mobile accounts, or local accounts.

[discrete]
==== Smartcard Management in macOS

The following settings are available to manage smartcards (com.apple.security.smartcard):

[%header,cols="2,1,7"]
|===
|Key
|Type
|Value

<.^|userPairing
^.^|bool
|If false, users will not get the pairing dialog, although existing pairings will still work.

<.^|allowSmartCard
^.^|bool
|If false, the SmartCard is disabled for logins, authorizations, and screensaver unlocking. It is still allowed for other functions, such as signing emails and web access. A restart is required for a change of setting to take effect.

<.^|checkCertificateTrust
^.^|int
a|Valid values are 0-3:

- 0: certificate trust check is turned off

- 1: certificate trust check is turned on. Standard validity check is being performed but this does not include additional revocation checks.

- 2: certificate trust check is turned on, and a soft revocation check is performed. Until the certificate is explicitly rejected by CRL/OCSP, it is considered valid. This implies that unavailable/unreachable CRL/OCSP allows this check to succeed.

- 3: certificate trust check is turned on, plus a hard revocation check is performed. Unless CRL/OCSP explicitly states that "this certificate is OK", the certificate is considered invalid. This is the most secure value for this setting.

<.^|oneCardPerUser
^.^|bool
|If true, a user can pair with only one smartcard, although existing pairings will be allowed if already set up.

<.^|enforceSmartCard
^.^|bool
|If true, a user can only login or authenticate with a smartcard.

<.^|tokenRemovalAction
^.^|int
|If 1, the screen saver will automatically when the smartcard is removed.

<.^|allowUnmappedUsers
^.^|int
|If 1, allows users who are in a directory group to be exempt from smartcard-only enforcement. The group allowed for exemption is defined in /private/etc/SmartcardLogin.plist

|===

A custom configuration profile (`com.apple.loginwindow`) should be created to disable automatic login when FileVault is enabled. This ensures that authorized users boot their Macs, enter a password at the pre-boot screen (which decrypts the boot volume), and are then presented with a login window where they can authenticate with a smartcard.

[%header,cols="2,1,7"]
|===
|Key
|Type
|Value

<.^|DisableFDEAutoLogin
^.^|bool
|If true, both Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) login password and loginwindow PIN are required.

|===

NOTE: DisableFDEAutoLogin does not have to be set on Apple Silicon based macOS systems that are smartcard enforced as smartcards are available at pre-boot.

[discrete]
==== Trusted Authorities
The macOS allows users to specify which certificate authorities (CA) can be used for trust evaluation during smartcard authentication. Only CAs listed in the TrustedAuthorities section of the SmartcardLogin.plist will be evaluated as trusted. This setting only works if `checkCertificateTrust` is set to either 1, 2, or 3 in `com.apple.security.smartcard`.

To get the SHA-256 hash in the correct format, run the following command within terminal:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -inform pem -in <issuer cert> | /usr/bin/awk -F '=' '{print $2}' |  /usr/bin/sed 's/://g'
----

To configure Trusted Authorities, the `SmartcardLogin.plist` should be minimally configured as below:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">

  </array>
</dict>
</plist>
----

[discrete]
==== Smartcard Enforcement Exemption

[discrete]
===== Group Exemption

Starting in macOS 10.15, enforcement on a system can be granularly configured by adding a field to `/private/etc/SmartcardLogin.plist`. The `NotEnforcedGroup` can be added to the file to list a Directory group that will not be included in smartcard enforcement. In order to activate this feature, `enforceSmartCard` and `allowUnmappedUsers` must be applied via a configuration profile (`com.apple.security.smartcard`).

To configure the `NotEnforcedGroup`, the `SmartcardLogin.plist` should be minimally configured as follows:
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>AttributeMapping</key>
    <dict>
          <key>fields</key>
          <array>
              <string>NT Principal Name</string>
          </array>
          <key>formatString</key>
          <string>Kerberos:$1</string>
          <key>dsAttributeString</key>
          <string>dsAttrTypeStandard:AltSecurityIdentities</string>
    </dict>
    <key>TrustedAuthorities</key>
  <array>
      <string>SHA256_HASH_OF_CERTDOMAIN_1,SHA256_HASH_OF_CERTDOMAIN_2</string>
  </array>
    <key>NotEnforcedGroup</key>
    <string>EXEMPTGROUP</key>
</dict>
</plist>
----

Once a system is configured for the `NotEnforcedGroup` a user can be added to the assigned group by running the following:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/sbin/dseditgroup -o edit -a <exempt_user> -t user <notenforcegroup>
----

[discrete]
===== User Exemption

Alternatively, if a single user needs to be exempt for a period of time, `kDSNativeAttrTypePrefix:SmartCardEnforcement` can be set in the user's Open Directory record. The following values can be set:

* 0 - The system default is respected.
* 1 - Smartcard enforcement is enabled.
* 2 - Smartcard enforcement is disabled. 

NOTE: In Active Directory environments, the value of the `userAccountControl` attribute is respected.

Run the following command to set the exemption when booted from macOS:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/dscl . -append /Users/<username> SmartCardEnforcement 2
----

Run the following command to set the exemption when booted from Recovery:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/defaults write /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/<username> SmartCardEnforcement -array-add 2
----
NOTE: When booted to recovery on an Apple Silicon Mac, run the following after setting the exemption.
`/usr/sbin/diskutil apfs updatePreboot /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD`

[discrete]
===== Temporary Exemption

On an Apple Silicon Mac, if a temporary exemption is needed, `security filevault skip-sc-enforcement` will disable smartcard enforcement on next boot only. 

Run the following command to set the temporary exemption when booted from Recovery:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/security filevault skip-sc-enforcement <data volume UUID> set
----

To obtain the `data volume UUID` run the following:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/sbin/diskutil apfs listGroups | /usr/bin/awk -F: '/ Data/ { getline; gsub(/ /,""); print $2}'
----

[discrete]
==== Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM)

Terminal sessions in macOS can be configured for smartcard enforcement by modifying the PAM modules for `sudo`, `su`, and `login`.

[source,bash]
----
/etc/pam.d/sudo
# sudo: auth account password session
auth        sufficient    pam_smartcard.so
