== Foreword

The macOS Security Compliance Project is an open source effort to provide a programmatic approach to generating security guidance. The configuration settings in this document were derived from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53, _Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations_, Revision 5.

This project can be used as a resource to easily create customized security baselines of technical security controls by leveraging a library of atomic actions which are mapped to the compliance requirements defined in NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5). It can also be used to develop customized guidance to meet the particular cybersecurity needs of any organization.  

The objective of this effort was to simplify and radically accelerate the process of producing up-to-date macOS security guidance that is also accessible to any organization and tailorable to meet each organizationâ€™s specific security needs.

Any and all risk based decisions to tailor the content produced by this project in order to meet the needs of a specific organization shall be approved by the responsible Information System Owner (ISO) and Authorizing Official (AO) and formally documented in their System Security Plan (SSP). While the project attempts to provide settings to meet compliance requirements, it is recommended that each rule be reviewed by your organization's Information System Security Officer (ISSO) prior to implementation.

== Scope

This guide describes the actions to take when securing a macOS system against the Apple macOS 12 (Monterey) STIG - Ver 1, Rel 1.

== Authentication

This section contains the configuration of authentication settings, including the enforcement of smartcard authentication.  

NOTE: The check/fix commands outlined in this section must be run with elevated privileges.

=== Enforce Multifactor Authentication for Login

The system _MUST_ be configured to enforce multifactor authentication.

All users _MUST_ go through multifactor authentication to prevent unauthenticated access and potential compromise to the system.

IMPORTANT: Modification of Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) now require user authorization, or use of a Privacy Preferences Policy Control (PPPC) profile from MDM that authorizes modifying system administrator files or full disk access.

NOTE: /etc/pam.d/login will be automatically modified to its original state following any update or major upgrade to the operating system.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/grep -Ec '^(auth\s+sufficient\s+pam_smartcard.so|auth\s+required\s+pam_deny.so)' /etc/pam.d/login

----

If the result is not *2*, this is a finding.

====
**Remediation Description**

Perform the following to configure the system to meet the requirements:

[source,bash]

=== Set Smartcard Certificate Trust to Moderate

The macOS system _MUST_ be configured to block access to users who are no longer authorized (i.e., users with revoked certificates).  

To prevent the use of untrusted certificates, the certificates on a smartcard card _MUST_ meet the following criteria: its issuer has a system-trusted certificate, the certificate is not expired, its "valid-after" date is in the past, and it passes Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) checking.

By setting the smartcard certificate trust level to moderate, the system will execute a soft revocation, i.e., if the OCSP/CRL server is unreachable, authentication will still succeed.

NOTE: Before applying this setting, please see the smartcard supplemental guidance.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/osascript -l JavaScript << EOS
$.NSUserDefaults.alloc.initWithSuiteName('com.apple.security.smartcard')\
.objectForKey('checkCertificateTrust').js

If the result is not *2*, this is a finding.

====
**Remediation Description**

Perform the following to configure the system to meet the requirements:

=== Enforce Smartcard Authentication

Smartcard authentication _MUST_ be enforced.

The use of smartcard credentials facilitates standardization and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

When enforceSmartCard is set to "true", the smartcard must be used for login, authorization, and unlocking the screensaver.

CAUTION: enforceSmartCard will apply to the whole system. No users will be able to login with their password unless the profile is removed or a user is exempt from smartcard enforcement.

NOTE: enforceSmartcard requires allowSmartcard to be set to true in order to work.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/osascript -l JavaScript << EOS
$.NSUserDefaults.alloc.initWithSuiteName('com.apple.security.smartcard')\

== Auditing

This section contains the configuration and enforcement of the OpenBSM settings.

NOTE: The BSM Audit subsystem has been marked as deprecated by Apple.

NOTE: The check/fix commands outlined in this section _MUST_ be run with elevated privileges. 

=== Configure Audit Log Files to Not Contain Access Control Lists

The audit log files _MUST_ not contain access control lists (ACLs).

This rule ensures that audit information and audit files are configured to be readable and writable only by system administrators, thereby preventing unauthorized access, modification, and deletion of files.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/bin/ls -le $(/usr/bin/grep '^dir' /etc/security/audit_control | /usr/bin/awk -F: '{print $2}') | /usr/bin/awk '{print $1}' | /usr/bin/grep -c ":"

=== Configure Audit Log Folder to Not Contain Access Control Lists

The audit log folder _MUST_ not contain access control lists (ACLs).

Audit logs contain sensitive data about the system and users. This rule ensures that the audit service is configured to create log folders that are readable and writable only by system administrators in order to prevent normal users from reading audit logs.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):

The information system _MUST_ be configured to generate audit records. 

Audit records establish what types of events have occurred, when they occurred, and which users were involved. These records aid an organization in their efforts to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.

The content required to be captured in an audit record varies based on the impact level of an organization's system. Content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes, for example, time stamps, source addresses, destination addresses, user identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access or flow control rules invoked.

The information system initiates session audits at system start-up.

NOTE: Security auditing is enabled by default on macOS.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/bin/launchctl list | /usr/bin/grep -c com.apple.auditd

----

If the result is not *1*, this is a finding.

=== Configure Audit Capacity Warning

The audit service _MUST_ be configured to notify the system administrator when the amount of free disk space remaining reaches an organization defined value. 

This rule ensures that the system administrator is notified in advance that action is required to free up more disk space for audit logs.

=== Configure System to Shut Down Upon Audit Failure

The audit service _MUST_ be configured to shut down the computer if it is unable to audit system events. 

Once audit failure occurs, user and system activity are no longer recorded, and malicious activity could go undetected. Audit processing failures can occur due to software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. 


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]

=== Configure Audit Log Files Group to Wheel

Audit log files _MUST_ have the group set to wheel.

The audit service _MUST_ be configured to create log files with the correct group ownership to prevent normal users from reading audit logs. 

Audit logs contain sensitive data about the system and users. If log files are set to be readable and writable only by system administrators, the risk is mitigated.

=== Configure System to Audit All Authorization and Authentication Events

The auditing system _MUST_ be configured to flag authorization and authentication (aa) events.

Authentication events contain information about the identity of a user, server, or client. Authorization events contain information about permissions, rights, and rules. If audit records do not include aa events, it is difficult to identify incidents and to correlate incidents to subsequent events. 

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., via a module or policy filter).


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]

=== Configure System to Audit All Administrative Action Events

The auditing system _MUST_ be configured to flag administrative action (ad) events.

Administrative action events include changes made to the system (e.g. modifying authentication policies). If audit records do not include ad events, it is difficult to identify incidents and to correlate incidents to subsequent events. 

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., via a module or policy filter). 

The information system audits the execution of privileged functions.

NOTE: We recommend changing the line "43127:AUE_MAC_SYSCALL:mac_syscall(2):ad" to "43127:AUE_MAC_SYSCALL:mac_syscall(2):zz" in the file /etc/security/audit_event. This will prevent sandbox violations from being audited by the ad flag.

=== Configure System to Audit All Log In and Log Out Events

The audit system _MUST_ be configured to record all attempts to log in and out of the system (lo). 

Frequently, an attacker that successfully gains access to a system has only gained access to an account with limited privileges, such as a guest account or a service account. The attacker must attempt to change to another user account with normal or elevated privileges in order to proceed. Auditing both successful and unsuccessful attempts to switch to another user account (by way of monitoring login and logout events) mitigates this risk.

The information system monitors login and logout events.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/awk -F':' '/^flags/ { print $NF }' /etc/security/audit_control | /usr/bin/tr ',' '\n' | /usr/bin/grep -Ec '^lo'

----

If the result is not *1*, this is a finding.

====
**Remediation Description**

Perform the following to configure the system to meet the requirements:

[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/grep -qE "^flags.*[^-]lo" /etc/security/audit_control || /usr/bin/sed -i.bak '/^flags/ s/$/,lo/' /etc/security/audit_control; /usr/sbin/audit -s

=== Enable Firmware Password

A firmware password _MUST_ be enabled and set. 

Single user mode, recovery mode, the Startup Manager, and several other tools are available on macOS by holding the "Option" key down during startup. Setting a firmware password restricts access to these tools.

To set a firmware passcode use the following command:

[source,bash]
----
/usr/sbin/firmwarepasswd -setpasswd
----

NOTE: If firmware password or passcode is forgotten, the only way to reset the forgotten password is through the use of a machine specific binary generated and provided by Apple. Schedule a support call, and provide proof of purchase before the firmware binary will be generated.

NOTE: Firmware passwords are not supported on Apple Silicon devices. This rule is only applicable to Intel devices.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/sbin/firmwarepasswd -check | /usr/bin/grep -c "Password Enabled: Yes"

----

If the result is not *1*, this is a finding.

====
**Remediation Description**

Perform the following to configure the system to meet the requirements:

NOTE: See discussion on remediation and how to enable firmware password.

Gatekeeper _MUST_ be enabled. 

Gatekeeper is a security feature that ensures that applications are digitally signed by an Apple-issued certificate before they are permitted to run. Digital signatures allow the macOS host to verify that the application has not been modified by a malicious third party.

Administrator users will still have the option to override these settings on a case-by-case basis.

=== Configure System Log Files to Mode 640 or Less Permissive

The system logs _MUST_ be configured to be writable by root and readable only by the root user and group wheel. To achieve this, system log files _MUST_ be configured to mode 640 permissive or less; thereby preventing normal users from reading, modifying or deleting audit logs.

=== Display Policy Banner at Remote Login

Remote login service _MUST_ be configured to display a policy banner at login. 

Displaying a standardized and approved use notification before granting access to the operating system ensures that users are provided with privacy and security notification verbiage that is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

System use notifications are required only for access via login interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
bannerText="You are accessing a U.S. Government information system, which includes: 1) this computer, 2) this computer network, 3) all Government-furnished computers connected to this network, and 4) all Government-furnished devices and storage media attached to this network or to a computer on this network. You understand and consent to the following: you may access this information system for authorized use only; unauthorized use of the system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties; you have no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system at any time and for any lawful Government purpose, the Government may monitor, intercept, audit, and search and seize any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system; and any communications or data transiting or stored on this information system may be disclosed or used for any lawful Government purpose.

=== Disable Removable Storage Devices

Removable media, such as USB connected external hard drives, thumb drives, and optical media, _MUST_ be disabled for users.

Disabling removable storage devices reduces the risks and known vulnerabilities of such devices (e.g., malicious code insertion)

[IMPORTANT]
====
Some organizations rely on the use of removable media for storing and sharing data. Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) may make the risk-based decision not to disable external hard drives to avoid losing this functionality, but they are advised to first fully weigh the potential risks posed to their organization.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Apple has deprecated the use of media mount controls, using these controls may not work as expected. Third party software may be required to fullfill the compliance requirements.

=== Ensure System Integrity Protection is Enabled

System Integrity Protection (SIP) _MUST_ be enabled. 

SIP is vital to protecting the integrity of the system as it prevents malicious users and software from making unauthorized and/or unintended modifications to protected files and folders; ensures the presence of an audit record generation capability for defined auditable events for all operating system components; protects audit tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion; restricts the root user account and limits the actions that the root user can perform on protected parts of the macOS; and prevents non-privileged users from granting other users direct access to the contents of their home directories and folders.

NOTE: SIP is enabled by default in macOS.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/csrutil status | /usr/bin/grep -c 'System Integrity Protection status: enabled.'

----

If the result is not *1*, this is a finding.

====
**Remediation Description**

Perform the following to configure the system to meet the requirements:

=== Set SSHD Active Client Alive Maximum to Zero

If SSHD is enabled it _MUST_ be configured with an Active Client Alive Maximum Count set to zero. Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session or an incomplete login attempt will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.

=== Limit SSHD to FIPS 140 Validated Message Authentication Code Algorithms

If SSHD is enabled then it _MUST_ be configured to limit the Message Authentication Codes (MACs) to algorithms that are FIPS 140 validated.

FIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to access cryptographic modules utilize authentication that meets federal requirements.

Operating systems utilizing encryption _MUST_ use FIPS validated mechanisms for authenticating to cryptographic modules. 

NOTE: /etc/ssh/sshd_config will be automatically modified to its original state following any update or major upgrade to the operating system.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/grep -c "^MACs hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512" /etc/ssh/sshd_config

----

If the result is not *1*, this is a finding.

=== Configure SSHD to Use Secure Key Exchange Algorithms

Unapproved mechanisms for authentication to the cryptographic module are not verified, and therefore cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, resulting in the compromise of DoD data.

Operating systems using encryption are required to use FIPS-compliant mechanisms for authenticating to cryptographic modules.

The implementation of OpenSSH that is included with macOS does not utilize a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module. While the listed Key Exchange Algorithms are FIPS 140-2 approved, the module implementing them has not been validated.

By specifying a Key Exchange Algorithm list with the order of hashes being in a "strongest to weakest" orientation, the system will automatically attempt to use the strongest Key Exchange Algorithm for securing SSH connections.

NOTE: /etc/ssh/sshd_config will be automatically modified to its original state following any update or major upgrade to the operating system.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/grep -c "^KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256" /etc/ssh/sshd_config

=== Configure Sudoers to Authenticate Users on a Per -tty Basis

The file /etc/sudoers _MUST_ be configured to include tty_tickets.

This rule ensures that the "sudo" command will prompt for the administrator's password at least once in each newly opened terminal window. This prevents a malicious user from taking advantage of an unlocked computer or an abandoned logon session by bypassing the normal password prompt requirement. Without the "tty_tickets" option, all open local and remote logon sessions would be authenticated to use sudo without a password for the duration of the configured password timeout window.

== Password Policy

This section contains the configuration and enforcement of settings pertaining to password policies in macOS.

NOTE: The check/fix commands outlined in this section _MUST_ be run by a user with elevated privileges. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
The password policy recommendations in the NIST 800-53 (Rev 5) and NIST 800-63B state that complexity rules should be organizationally defined. The values defined are based off of common complexity values. But your organization may define its own password complexity rules.
====

NOTE: The settings outlined in this section adhere to the recommendations provided in this document for systems that utilize passwords for local accounts. If systems are integrated with a directory service, local password policies should align with domain password policies to the fullest extent feasible.

=== Restrict Maximum Password Lifetime to 60 Days

The macOS _MUST_ be configured to enforce a maximum password lifetime limit of at least 60 days. 

This rule ensures that users are forced to change their passwords frequently enough to prevent malicious users from gaining and maintaining access to the system.

This rule enforces password complexity by requiring users to set passwords that are less vulnerable to malicious users. 

NOTE: The guidance for password based authentication in NIST 800-53 (Rev 5) and NIST 800-63B state that complexity rules should be organizationally defined. The values defined are based off of common complexity values. But your organization may define its own password complexity rules.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]

=== Prohibit Password Reuse for a Minimum of Five Generations

The macOS _MUST_ be configured to enforce a password history of at least five previous passwords when a password is created. 

This rule ensures that users are  not allowed to re-use a password that was used in any of the five previous password generations. 

Limiting password reuse protects against malicious users attempting to gain access to the system via brute-force hacking methods.

NOTE: The guidance for password based authentication in NIST 800-53 (Rev 5) and NIST 800-63B state that complexity rules should be organizationally defined. The values defined are based off of common complexity values. But your organization may define its own password complexity rules.

=== Require Passwords Contain a Minimum of One Special Character

The macOS _MUST_ be configured to require at least one special character be used when a password is created.

=== Automatically Remove or Disable Temporary or Emergency User Accounts within 72 Hours

The macOS is able to be configured to set an automated termination for 72 hours or less for all temporary or emergency accounts upon account creation. 

Emergency administrator accounts are privileged accounts established in response to crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is required. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability.

Although the ability to create and use emergency administrator accounts is necessary for performing system maintenance during emergencies, these accounts present vulnerabilities to the system if they are not disabled and removed when they are no longer needed. Configuring the macOS to automatically remove or disable emergency accounts within 72 hours of creation mitigates the risks posed if one were to be created and accidentally left active once the crisis is resolved. 

Emergency administrator accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon is not available). Infrequently used accounts also remain available and are not subject to automatic termination dates. However, an emergency administrator account is normally a different account created for use by vendors or system maintainers.

To address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.

If temporary or emergency user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for an excessive period, these accounts may be targeted by attackers to gain unauthorized access. To mitigate this risk, automated termination of all temporary or emergency accounts _MUST_ be set to 72 hours (or less) when the temporary or emergency account is created.

If no policy is enforced by a directory service, a password policy can be set with the "pwpolicy" utility. The variable names may vary depending on how the policy was set.

If there are no temporary or emergency accounts defined on the system, this is Not Applicable.


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
Verify if a password policy is enforced by a directory service by asking the System Administrator (SA) or Information System Security Officer (ISSO). 

If no policy is enforced by a directory service, a password policy can be set with the "pwpolicy" utility. The variable names may vary depending on how the policy was set. 

If there are no temporary or emergency accounts defined on the system, this is Not Applicable.

To check if the password policy is configured to disable a temporary or emergency account after 72 hours, run the following command to output the password policy to the screen, substituting the correct user name in place of username:

/usr/bin/pwpolicy -u username getaccountpolicies | tail -n +2

If there is no output, and password policy is not controlled by a directory service, this is a finding.

Otherwise, look for the line "<key>policyCategoryAuthentication</key>".

In the array that follows, there should be a <dict> section that contains a check <string> that allows users to log in if "policyAttributeCurrentTime" is less than the result of adding "policyAttributeCreationTime" to 72 hours (259299 seconds). The check might use a variable defined in its "policyParameters" section.

If the check does not exist or if the check adds too great an amount of time to "policyAttributeCreationTime", this is a finding.

----

If the result is not *N/A*, this is a finding.

====
**Remediation Description**

Perform the following to configure the system to meet the requirements:

This setting may be enforced using local policy or by a directory service.

To set local policy to disable a temporary or emergency user, create a plain text file containing the following:

<dict>
<key>policyCategoryAuthentication</key>
<array>
<dict>
<key>policyContent</key>
<string>policyAttributeCurrentTime < policyAttributeCreationTime+259299</string>
<key>policyIdentifier</key>
<string>Disable Tmp Accounts </string>
</dict>
</array>
</dict>

After saving the file and exiting to the command prompt, run the following command to load the new policy file, substituting the correct user name in place of "username" and the path to the file in place of "/path/to/file".

/usr/bin/pwpolicy -u username setaccountpolicies /path/to/file

=== Disable Unattended or Automatic Logon to the System

Automatic logon _MUST_ be disabled.

When automatic logons are enabled, the default user account is automatically logged on at boot time without prompting the user for a password.

=== Enable Firewall Stealth Mode

Firewall Stealth Mode _MUST_ be enabled. 

When stealth mode is enabled, the Mac will not respond to any probing requests, and only requests from authorized applications will still be authorized.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Enabling firewall stealth mode may prevent certain remote mechanisms used for maintenance and compliance scanning from properly functioning. Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) are advised to first fully weigh the potential risks posed to their organization before opting not to enable stealth mode.

=== Apply Gatekeeper Settings to Block Applications from Unidentified Developers

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate software prior to installation.

Gatekeeper settings must be configured correctly to only allow the system to run applications downloaded from the Mac App Store or applications signed with a valid Apple Developer ID code. Administrator users will still have the option to override these settings on a per-app basis. Gatekeeper is a security feature that ensures that applications must be digitally signed by an Apple-issued certificate in order to run. Digital signatures allow the macOS to verify that the application has not been modified by a malicious third party.

Hot corners _MUST_ be disabled. 

The information system conceals, via the session lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly viewable image. Although hot comers can be used to initiate a session lock or to launch useful applications, they can also be configured to disable an automatic session lock from initiating. Such a configuration introduces the risk that a user might forget to manually lock the screen before stepping away from the computer.

=== Configure User Session Lock When a Smart Token is Removed

The screen lock _MUST_ be configured to initiate automatically when the smart token is removed from the system.

Session locks are temporary actions taken when users stop work and move away from the immediate vicinity of the information system but do not want to log out because of the temporary nature of their absences. While a session lock is not an acceptable substitute for logging out of an information system for longer periods of time, they prevent a malicious user from accessing the information system when a user has removed their smart token. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) may make the risk-based decision not to enforce a session lock when a smart token is removed, so as to maintain necessary workflow capabilities, but they are advised to first fully weigh the potential risks posed to their organization.

=== Hide the System Preference Pane for Touch ID

The system preference pane for Touch ID _MUST_ be hidden.

Hiding the system preference pane prevents the users from configuring Touch ID. 


To check the state of the system, run the following command(s):
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
/usr/bin/profiles -P -o stdout | /usr/bin/grep -c 'com.apple.preferences.password' | /usr/bin/awk '{ if ($1 >= 1) {print "1"} else {print "0"}}'

----

If the result is not *1*, this is a finding.

====
**Remediation Description**

Perform the following to configure the system to meet the requirements:

Create a configuration profile containing the following keys in the (com.apple.systempreferences) payload type:

[source,xml]
----
<key>HiddenPreferencePanes</key>

== Supplemental

This section provides additional information to support the guidance provided by the baselines.

=== Out of Scope Supplemental

There are several requirements defined in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations, Revision 5 that can be met by making configuration changes to the operating system. However, NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5) contains a broad set of guidelines that attempt to address all aspects of an information system or systems within an organization. Because the macOS Security Compliance Project is tailored specifically to macOS, some requirements defined in NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5) are not applicable. 

This supplemental contains those controls that are assigned to a baseline in NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5) which cannot be addressed with a technical configuration for macOS. These controls can be accomplished though administrative or procedural processes within an organization or via integration of the macOS system into enterprise information systems which are configured to protect the systems within.

=== FileVault Supplemental

The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:
  * sysprefs_filevault_enforce

In macOS 11 the internal Apple File System (APFS) data volume can be protected by FileVault. The system volume is always cryptographically protected (T2 and Apple Silicon) and is a read-only volume.

NOTE: FileVault uses an AES-XTS data encryption algorithm to protect full volumes of internal and external storage. Macs with a secure enclave (T2 and Apple Silicon) utilize the hardware security features of the architecture.

FileVault is described in detail here: link:https://support.apple.com/guide/security/volume-encryption-with-filevault-sec4c6dc1b6e/web[].

FileVault can be enabled in two ways within the macOS. It can be managed using the fdesetup command or by a Configuration Profile. When enabling FileVault via either of the aforementioned methods, you will be required to enter a username and password, which must be a local Open Directory account with a valid SecureToken password.

[discrete]
==== Using the fdesetup Command
When enabling FileVault via the command line in the Terminal application, you can run the following command.
[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/fdesetup enable
----
Running this command will prompt you for a username and password and then enable FileVault and return the personal recovery key. There are a number of management features available when managing FileVault via the command line that are not available when using a configuration profile. More information on these management features is available in the man page for `fdesetup`. 

NOTE: Apple has deprecated `fdesetup` command line tool from recognizing user name and password for security reasons and may remove the ability in future versions of macOS. 

[discrete]
==== Using a Configuration Profile

When managing FileVault with a configuration profile, you must deploy a profile with the payload type `com.apple.MCX.FileVault2`. When using the Enable key to enable FileVault with a configuration profile, you must include 1 of the following:

[source,xml]
----
<key>Enable</key>
<string>On</string>
<key>Defer</key>
<true />
----
[source,xml]
----
<key>Enable</key>
<string>On</string>
<key>UserEntersMissingInfo</key>
<true/>
----

If using the Defer key it will prompt for the user name and password at logout.

The `UserEntersMissingInfo` key will only work if installed through manual installation, and it will prompt for the username and password immediately. 

When using a configuration profile, you can escrow the Recovery key to a Mobile Device Management (MDM) server. Documentation for that can be found on Apple's Developer site: link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/fderecoverykeyescrow[].

It's recommended that you use a Personal Recovery key instead of an Institutional key as it will generate a specific key for each device. You can find more guidance on choosing a recover key here: link:https://docs.jamf.com/technical-papers/jamf-pro/administering-filevault-macos/10.7.1/Choosing_a_Recovery_Key.html[].

NOTE: FileVault currently only uses password-based authentication and cannot be done using a smartcard or any other type of multi-factor authentication. 


=== Packet Filter (pf) Supplemental

The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:

*	os_firewall_default_deny_require

macOS contains an application layer firewall (ALF) and a packet filter (PF) firewall.

  * The ALF can block incoming traffic on a per-application basis and prevent applications from gaining control of network ports, but it cannot be configured to block outgoing traffic.
  ** More information on the ALF can be found here: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201642 

  *  The PF firewall can manipulate virtually any packet data and is highly configurable. 
  ** More information on the BF firewall can be found here: https://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/index.html

Below is a script that configures ALF and the PF firewall to meet the requirements defined in NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5). The script will make sure the application layer firewall is enabled, set logging to "detailed", set built-in signed applications to automatically receive incoming connections, and set downloaded signed applications to automatically receive incoming connections. It will then create a custom rule set and copy `com.apple.pfctl.plis` from `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/` into the `/Library/LaunchDaemons` folder and name it `800-53.pfctl.plist`. This is done to not conflict with the system's pf ruleset.

The custom pf rules are created at `/etc/pf.anchors/800_53_pf_anchors`.

The ruleset will block connections on the following ports:

[%header,width="100%",cols="3,7"]

=== Password Policy Supplemental

The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:

  * pwpolicy_lower_case_character_enforce
  * pwpolicy_upper_case_character_enforce
  * pwpolicy_account_inactivity_enforce
  * pwpolicy_minimum_lifetime_enforce

Password policies should be enforced as much as possible via Configuration Profiles. However, the following policies are currently not enforceable via Configuration Profiles, and must therefore be enabled using the `pwpolicy` command:

  * Enforcing at least 1 lowercase character
  * Enforcing at least 1 uppercase character
  * Disabling an account after 35 days of inactivity
  * Password minimum lifetime

To set the local policy to meet these requirements, save the following XML password policy to a file.

[source,xml]
----
include::../../includes/pwpolicy.xml[]
----

Run the following command to load the new policy file, substituting the path to the file in place of "$pwpolicy_file".

[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/pwpolicy setaccountpolicies $pwpolicy_file
----

[NOTE]
====
If directory services is being utilized, password policies should come from the domain.

=== Smartcard Supplemental

The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:

  * auth_ssh_password_authentication_disable
  * auth_smartcard_enforce
  * auth_smartcard_certificate_trust_enforce_moderate
  * auth_smartcard_certificate_trust_enforce_high
  * auth_smartcard_allow
  * auth_pam_sudo_smartcard_enforce
  * auth_pam_su_smartcard_enforce
  * auth_pam_login_smartcard_enforce

macOS supports smartcards, such as U.S. Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards and U.S. Department of Defense Common Access Cards (CAC). Smartcards can be used on a macOS for the following:

  * Authentication (Loginwindow, Screensaver, SSH, PKINIT, Safari, Finder, and PAM Authorization (`sudo`, `login`, and `su`) )
  * Digital Encryption
  * Digital Signing
  * Remote Access (VPN:L2TP)
  * Port-based Network Access Control (802.1X)
  * Keychain Unlock

macOS has built-in support for USB CCID class-compliant smartcard readers.

[discrete]
==== Smartcard Pairing
The default method for using smartcards in macOS is a method called "local account pairing". Local account pairing is automatically initiated when a user inserts a smartcard into the Mac. The user is prompted to pair their smartcard with their account. If a user receives a new smartcard, the previous card must be unpaired, and the new card paired to the account. Local account pairing employs fixed key mapping with the hash of a public key on the user's smartcard with a local account.

[discrete]
==== Smartcard Attribute Mapping
Smartcards can be used to authenticate against a directory via attribute mapping configured in `/private/etc/SmartcardLogin.plist`. This file takes precedence over local account pairing. Attribute mapping matches the configured certificate field values from the smart card to the value in a directory. This may be used with network accounts, mobile accounts, or local accounts.

[discrete]
==== Smartcard Management in macOS

The following settings are available to manage smartcards (com.apple.security.smartcard):

[%header,cols="2,1,7"]
|===
|Key
|Type
|Value

<.^|userPairing
^.^|bool
|If false, users will not get the pairing dialog, although existing pairings will still work.

<.^|allowSmartCard
^.^|bool
|If false, the SmartCard is disabled for logins, authorizations, and screensaver unlocking. It is still allowed for other functions, such as signing emails and web access. A restart is required for a change of setting to take effect.

<.^|checkCertificateTrust
^.^|int
a|Valid values are 0-3:

- 0: certificate trust check is turned off

- 1: certificate trust check is turned on. Standard validity check is being performed but this does not include additional revocation checks.

- 2: certificate trust check is turned on, and a soft revocation check is performed. Until the certificate is explicitly rejected by CRL/OCSP, it is considered valid. This implies that unavailable/unreachable CRL/OCSP allows this check to succeed.

- 3: certificate trust check is turned on, plus a hard revocation check is performed. Unless CRL/OCSP explicitly states that "this certificate is OK", the certificate is considered invalid. This is the most secure value for this setting.

<.^|oneCardPerUser
^.^|bool
|If true, a user can pair with only one smartcard, although existing pairings will be allowed if already set up.

<.^|enforceSmartCard
^.^|bool
|If true, a user can only login or authenticate with a smartcard.

<.^|tokenRemovalAction
^.^|int
|If 1, the screen saver will automatically when the smartcard is removed.

<.^|allowUnmappedUsers
^.^|int
|If 1, allows users who are in a directory group to be exempt from smartcard-only enforcement. The group allowed for exemption is defined in /private/etc/SmartcardLogin.plist

|===

A custom configuration profile (`com.apple.loginwindow`) should be created to disable automatic login when FileVault is enabled. This ensures that authorized users boot their Macs, enter a password at the pre-boot screen (which decrypts the boot volume), and are then presented with a login window where they can authenticate with a smartcard.

[%header,cols="2,1,7"]
|===
|Key
|Type
|Value

<.^|DisableFDEAutoLogin
^.^|bool
|If true, both Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) login password and loginwindow PIN are required.

|===

NOTE: DisableFDEAutoLogin does not have to be set on Apple Silicon based macOS systems that are smartcard enforced as smartcards are available at pre-boot.

[discrete]
==== Trusted Authorities
The macOS allows users to specify which certificate authorities (CA) can be used for trust evaluation during smartcard authentication. Only CAs listed in the TrustedAuthorities section of the SmartcardLogin.plist will be evaluated as trusted. This setting only works if `checkCertificateTrust` is set to either 1, 2, or 3 in `com.apple.security.smartcard`.

To get the SHA-256 hash in the correct format, run the following command within terminal:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -inform pem -in <issuer cert> | /usr/bin/awk -F '=' '{print $2}' |  /usr/bin/sed 's/://g'
----

To configure Trusted Authorities, the `SmartcardLogin.plist` should be minimally configured as below:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>AttributeMapping</key>

              <string>NT Principal Name</string>
          </array>
          <key>formatString</key>
          <string>Kerberos:$1</string>
          <key>dsAttributeString</key>

    </dict>
    <key>TrustedAuthorities</key>
  <array>
      <string>SHA256_HASH_OF_CERTDOMAIN_1,SHA256_HASH_OF_CERTDOMAIN_2</string>
  </array>
</dict>
</plist>
----

[discrete]
==== Smartcard Enforcement Exemption

[discrete]
===== Group Exemption

Starting in macOS 10.15, enforcement on a system can be granularly configured by adding a field to `/private/etc/SmartcardLogin.plist`. The `NotEnforcedGroup` can be added to the file to list a Directory group that will not be included in smartcard enforcement. In order to activate this feature, `enforceSmartCard` and `allowUnmappedUsers` must be applied via a configuration profile (`com.apple.security.smartcard`).

To configure the `NotEnforcedGroup`, the `SmartcardLogin.plist` should be minimally configured as follows:
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>AttributeMapping</key>
    <dict>
          <key>fields</key>
          <array>
              <string>NT Principal Name</string>
          </array>
          <key>formatString</key>
          <string>Kerberos:$1</string>
          <key>dsAttributeString</key>
          <string>dsAttrTypeStandard:AltSecurityIdentities</string>
    </dict>
    <key>TrustedAuthorities</key>
  <array>
      <string>SHA256_HASH_OF_CERTDOMAIN_1,SHA256_HASH_OF_CERTDOMAIN_2</string>
  </array>
    <key>NotEnforcedGroup</key>
    <string>EXEMPTGROUP</key>
</dict>
</plist>
----

Once a system is configured for the `NotEnforcedGroup` a user can be added to the assigned group by running the following:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/sbin/dseditgroup -o edit -a <exempt_user> -t user <notenforcegroup>
----

[discrete]
===== User Exemption

Alternatively, if a single user needs to be exempt for a period of time, `kDSNativeAttrTypePrefix:SmartCardEnforcement` can be set in the user's Open Directory record. The following values can be set:

* 0 - The system default is respected.
* 1 - Smartcard enforcement is enabled.
* 2 - Smartcard enforcement is disabled. 

NOTE: In Active Directory environments, the value of the `userAccountControl` attribute is respected.

Run the following command to set the exemption when booted from macOS:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/dscl . -append /Users/<username> SmartCardEnforcement 2
----

Run the following command to set the exemption when booted from Recovery:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/defaults write /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/<username> SmartCardEnforcement -array-add 2
----
NOTE: When booted to recovery on an Apple Silicon Mac, run the following after setting the exemption.
`/usr/sbin/diskutil apfs updatePreboot /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD`

[discrete]
===== Temporary Exemption

On an Apple Silicon Mac, if a temporary exemption is needed, `security filevault skip-sc-enforcement` will disable smartcard enforcement on next boot only. 

Run the following command to set the temporary exemption when booted from Recovery:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/security filevault skip-sc-enforcement <data volume UUID> set
----

To obtain the `data volume UUID` run the following:
[source,bash]
----
/usr/sbin/diskutil apfs listGroups | /usr/bin/awk -F: '/ Data/ { getline; gsub(/ /,""); print $2}'
----

[discrete]
==== Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM)

Terminal sessions in macOS can be configured for smartcard enforcement by modifying the PAM modules for `sudo`, `su`, and `login`.

[source,bash]
----
/etc/pam.d/sudo
# sudo: auth account password session
auth        sufficient    pam_smartcard.so
auth        required      pam_opendirectory.so
